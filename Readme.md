CleanPortalEval  
It is a boilerplate removal test set for portals.

It is similar to CleanEval test set, but it contains more pages from the same domain. Motivation of the dataset: some boilerplate removal algorithms need more sample from a domain. (e.g. GoldMiner)  
Its input and its gold standard has the same format as CleanEval has. So the evaluation script can be used on these, as well.

It contains 70 pages from 4 domains.
