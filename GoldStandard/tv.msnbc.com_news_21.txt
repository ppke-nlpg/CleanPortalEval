<h>Should teacher unions get a failing grade on education reform?

<p>Margaret Spellings, the former Secretary of Education under George
 W. Bush, and L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa join The Daily
 Rundown’s Chuck Todd to talk about teacher unions, charter
 schools versus public schools, and investing in education and
 teachers.

<p>The Chicago Teacher Union strike only came to an end last week,
 but it has left many asking questions. People are wondering
 if teacher unions are to blame for slow education reform, or
 if they are a solution to a bigger problem.

<p>On today&#8217;s show, Chuck asked both Margaret Spellings, the
 former Secretary of Education under George W.  Bush, and L.A.
 Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa if teacher unions are to blame for
 slow education reform. Hear what they had to say below.

<p>And don&#8217;t miss the Today Show&#8217;s interview with President
 Obama. Co-anchor Savannah Guthrie asked President Obama the
 same question on teacher unions in an interview over the weekend.
 The President responded by saying he gets frustrated when he
 hears teacher bashing.

<p>&#8220;You know, I just really get frustrated when I hear  teacher-bashing
 as evidence of reform,&#8221; Obama said.

<p>He went on to say, &#8220;What is absolutely true is if we&#8217;ve 
 got a bad teacher, we should be able to train them to get better,
 and if  they can&#8217;t get better, they should be able to
 get fired.&#8221;
