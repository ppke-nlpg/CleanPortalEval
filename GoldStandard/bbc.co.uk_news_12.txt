<h>India building collapse near Mumbai kills 40

<p>At least 40 people have died, including 11 children, after a
 building under construction collapsed near the Indian city of
 Mumbai, police say.

<p>Dozens have been injured and many others are feared trapped beneath
 the seven-storey building in Thane. 

<p>Police said the block was an illegal construction and building work
 was going on even though four floors were already occupied.

<p>Building collapses are common with poor construction practices often blamed.

<p>The BBC&#039;s Sameer Hashmi, who is at the scene of the accident,
 says rescue workers are still trying to clear the debris.

<p>The building collapse underlines the issue of illegal construction in
 India. 

<p>Police say the builder of the high rise used sub-standard
 construction material and did not possess an occupation certificate.

<p>There are hundreds of similar illegal high rises in the Mumbai
 region. Due to a high population growth, there is always demand
 for cheap housing. And homes in illegal buildings sell at a lower
 price compared to those in legal ones. 

<p>Activists also allege that unscrupulous builders often pay hefty
 bribes to authorities who turn a blind eye to these illegal
 structures and do not take any action against the builders.

<p>Bodies are still being pulled out and rescuers say they fear that
 many people are still stuck under the rubble, our correspondent says.

<p>Most people living in the building are from the low-to-middle income
 groups, he adds. 

<p>Witnesses say the construction of the building started just six weeks
 ago and in that time, seven floors were built rapidly and the
 eighth floor was under construction. 

<p>Even though the construction was incomplete, the builder had allowed
 families to move in, our correspondent adds. 

<p>On Thursday evening a section of the building collapsed, bringing the
 entire structure down, police said.

<p>Rescue efforts continued throughout the night and dozens have been injured.

<p>It is not yet clear what caused the collapse, but police inspector
 Digamber Jangale told the BBC it appeared to be due to the use
 of substandard building material. 

<p>Police said a case had been registered and an inquiry had begun and
 that they were searching for the builders to arrest them.

<p>One witness, named only as Ramlal, said the building appeared to
 tilt before quickly collapsing.

<p>"The building collapsed like a pack of cards within three to four
 seconds," he said.

<p>In December, at least 13 people died when part of a half-constructed
 building collapsed in the Wagholi area of Maharashtra.

<p>Last September, at least six people were killed when a building
 collapsed in Pune city in Maharashtra.
