<h>ESM and Banks: Not So Soon

<p>Spain is talking more openly than ever about needing help from
 Europe to recapitalize its banks, as budget minister Cristóbal
 Montoro told a radio station in Madrid on Tuesday.

<p>If euro-zone help is to be forthcoming for Spanish banks, Spain
 (and some others) would prefer that it&#8217;s directed from
 the bailout funds straight to the banks, rather than via the
 government as it would be under current rules. The problem with
 lending to the government to recapitalize banks is that it increases
 the government&#8217;s debt, further intensifying the spiral
 in which weak banks lead to increases in government debt, and
 therefore heightening worries about government solvency, which
 in turn increases concerns about the banks.

<p>But it&#8217;s not immediately clear how you convert the European
 Stability Mechanism, the euro zone&#8217;s bailout fund that
 should come into existence soon, from a vehicle designed to
 make loans to governments into one that injects equity into
 banks. At the very least, the questions it raises suggest such
 a step may not be achievable soon&#8211;even absent any political
 obstacles such as the need for treaty change.

<p>Under the current system, a government borrows money from the
 bailout funds to inject into the banks. In return, the lenders
 demand conditions of the government and the government sets
 the terms and conditions of the banks for its injection of equity.
 If the ESM were to directly inject equity then it would presumably
 have to determine the terms and conditions of those injections.
 The &#8220;question of oversight, imposition and oversight of
 conditionalities becomes much more salient and problematic,&#8221;
 says Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group. Monitoring of the conditions
 would presumably have to be done by the European Banking Authority,
 he suggests.

<p>Then, there&#8217;s the question of whether lenders will lose
 their leverage over governments if the banks are recapitalized
 directly, surely an important issue for Germany and other providers
 of aid. 

<p>The issue becomes even more complex where banks have cross-border
 subsidiaries, Mr. Rahman points out.

<p>Other questions: equity is riskier than debt, and the size of
 the bailout funds might be needed to be increased to take this
 new role, given the size of Europe&#8217;s banking systems.
 Finally, if Spain gets this concession, might not Ireland be
 entitled to ask for it in retrospect?
