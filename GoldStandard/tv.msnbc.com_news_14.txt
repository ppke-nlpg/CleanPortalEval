<h>My reaction to the Fab 5 winning the gold

<p>The other night, as I watched the U.S. Women&#8217;s Gymnastics
 team stand on the podium and listen to the National Anthem &#8211;
 I felt a complicated emotion roll over me. I couldn&#8217;t
 quite put my finger on it. Sure, there was the basic pride and
 excitement you feel for a gold medalist that represents your
 country. And as always, I was blown away by their talent and
 their execution.

<p>But after all of the montages, the interviews, the replays and
 rehashing &#8211; I finally stuck the landing and figured it
 out. Jealousy. I&#8217;m jealous of these girls. Please don&#8217;t
 mistake this for the garden variety, school yard-ish, jealousy
 that inspired &#8220;Mean Girls.&#8221; Trust me, I harbor no
 ill will towards them. In fact, it&#8217;s quite the opposite.
 I&#8217;m envious.

<p>It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been wrestling with (shout out
 to Rulon Gardiner) for as long as I&#8217;ve been watching &#8211;
 or rather, worshiping the Olympics. I&#8217;m completely and
 whole-heartedly jealous of Olympians. I&#8217;m jealous of their
 dedication. I&#8217;m jealous of their execution. I&#8217;m
 jealous of the linear drive that allows you to figure out exactly
 what you want to do, what you love to do &#8211; and then see
 it through to the highest level on the planet. I&#8217;m terrified
 I&#8217;ll never know it.

<p>At times, I think we as Americans see a great performance, be
 it music, theater, or athletic &#8211; and think of it as a
 solitary shining moment. But it&#8217;s not, for every tumble,
 vault, run, sprint, shot, jump, parry, and row we see on TV
 &#8211; there have been hundreds, thousands, maybe even millions
 before it. Do you know how many times Gabby Douglas has had
 to swing around those uneven bars like a yo-yo in order to put
 forth a performance like we saw Tuesday?

<p>That kind of drive is insane to me. And I openly covet it.

<p>That&#8217;s why I had to briefly change the channel as Team
 Russia&#8217;s dreams crashed to the floor, even though I already
 knew it long before I saw it on TV. It&#8217;s hard to watch
 that devotion, that effort, that life&#8217;s work go unrewarded.
 Of course they cried, I wanted to cry.

<p>I used to want to search for Treasure Island, play in the NBA,
 be a sports reporter, and maybe go to the Moon if there was
 time. Now, I want to cover the news in war zones, write a TV
 show, and maybe write a movie. All of those goals would take
 a dedication I&#8217;m not sure I possess (and a boat and rocket
 ship I definitely don&#8217;t have). So any time I see somebody
 reach the top of their personal mountaintop, there&#8217;s a
 small part of me that looks begrudgingly uphill at my own. And
 trust me, I&#8217;m knowingly using all the definitions of &#8220;small&#8221;
 in that last sentence.

<p>But you know what? I&#8217;m not even embarrassed about it. Jealousy
 doesn&#8217;t have to be ugly. Some people get their inspiration
 from life experiences, some get it from winning, others from
 losing, some say it&#8217;s intrinsic and other claim it&#8217;s
 divine.  Honestly, I&#8217;m not the type to see these girls&#8217;
 greatness, and be inspired to go out and strive for my own (Murica!).
 I&#8217;m not wired that way. But, I secretly hope the jealousy
 drags some greatness out of me, helping me focus and prioritize
 &#8211; even if it&#8217;s out of sheer self-hatred.  Truth
 be told, I&#8217;ve just always seemed to run a little faster
 when I&#8217;m glancing over my shoulder.
