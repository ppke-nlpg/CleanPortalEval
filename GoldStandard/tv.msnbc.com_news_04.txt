<h>Voting for Obama isn&#8217;t the &#8216;white man&#8217;s burden&#8217;

<p>Melissa Harris-Perry reads her open letter to Washington Post
 columnist George Will over his column from Monday that argued
 against a second term for President Obama.

<p>On Saturday&#8217;s edition of her MSNBC show, Melissa Harris-Perry
 read an open letter to Washington Post George Will, whose October
 1 column posited that President Obama&#8217;s good fortune
 in the polls to this point was due less to white guilt over
 giving up on America&#8217;s first black president.

<p>Every now and then, I like to push back from the big panel and
 give some people individualized attention. And sometimes the
 best way to make your point is with a personalized touch, like
 a letter. So George Will, this one&#8217;s for you.

<p>Dear George. It&#8217;s me &#8230; Melissa.

<p>On Monday, your column made a case for rejecting President
 Barack Obama&#8217;s re-election bid. It was based on our tough
 economic realities and questioned whether Mitt Romney could
 turn this contest around.

<p>Now, let&#8217;s be clear, I disagree with your assessment of
 the Obama administration, but the first part of your argument
 in reasonable. It is based in empirical realities.  You convincingly
 demonstrate that Americans have had a tough time fiscally in
 the past four years. I might disagree with you about the causal
 relationships between the economic factors you cite and the
 Obama administration but I don&#8217;t argue with your data.

<p>Which means I hope you won&#8217;t quibble with the new data
 released yesterday showing unemployment fell to 7.8 percent,
 and also offering upward revisions of job growth, and an additional
 114 thousand jobs created last month. But after a reasonable
 start you went off the rails a bit by writing this,

<p>&#8220;Obama&#8217;s administration is in shambles, yet he is
 prospering politically. This may not, however, entirely be evidence
 of the irrationality of the electorate. Something more benign
 may be at work.&#8221;

<p>Interesting word choice, benign. Because what you really mean
 is something sinister. You suspect something is amiss when,
 even after the President&#8217;s meager performance in Wednesday&#8217;s
 debate &#8230; he still enjoys a 46 percent to 44 percent lead
 over challenger Mitt Romney.

<p>See, George, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s all that paradoxical.
 It could it be that Democrats have effectively linked Romney
 with candidates, elected officials, and policies that represent
 the extreme anti-reproductive rights initiatives in the Republican
 party. That big gender gap could be because of transvaginal
 McDonnell, &#8220;Legitimate Rape &#8221; [Todd] Akin, and no-pills
 [Rick] Santorum.

<p>Or George, perhaps it&#8217;s that Mr. Romney chose a running
 mate who advocated transforming Medicare into a voucher system.
 That just might have caused some reliably conservative seniors
 to reconsider their willingness to support the president.

<p>And George -  it could be that until Wednesday night Mitt Romney
 had run a breathtakingly uninspiring campaign pockmarked with
 gaffes, inconsistencies, and evasion.

<p>No, George, you took none of this into account. Instead you wrote
 the President&#8217;s lead is solid because- and I&#8217;m not
 sure if anyone else has noticed this- it&#8217;s because the
 president is *black.* You say:

<p>&#8220;&#8230; the nation, which is generally reluctant to declare
 a president a failure &#8211; thereby admitting that it made
 a mistake in choosing him &#8211; seems reluctant to give up
 on the first African American president.&#8221;

<p>Right, George &#8212; because we all know that black men hold
 an unfair advantage in the labor market. You can see evidence
 of it all around you!

<p>After decades of racial good will shown to black workers as a
 result of the unfairly imposed guilt trip by radical race-card
 playing media types like me, black workers now have an unemployment
 rate of 13 point 4 percent.

<p>Yeah, racial guilt. That&#8217;s it.

<p>Whew, well, I hereby give you permission to set down the white
 man&#8217;s burden. If you don&#8217;t want to vote for the
 president &#8230; don&#8217;t. Plenty of other voters seems
 to have found actual reasons to support him.

<p>Sincerely,

<p>Melissa
