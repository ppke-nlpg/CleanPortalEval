<h>Editors' note: New choices for washingtonpost.com readers

<p>The Washington Post&rsquo;s Web site serves millions of readers
 who have different interests and needs. Our U.S. and international
 audiences come to us to understand Washington, D.C. &mdash;
 its politics, personalities, institutions, agencies and policies
 &mdash; and what that means to America as well as to the world.
 As a news organization rooted in the greater D.C. metro area,
 we also serve readers who come from the District, Virginia and
 Maryland by providing deep and unparalleled coverage of regional
 sports, politics, traffic, weather, real estate, crime, education,
 arts, culture and more. 

<p>Based on feedback from both these audiences, as of today, we
 are offering washingtonpost.com readers the ability to quickly
 access more of our local/regional content and top news headlines
 from our main homepage. For readers who live in greater D.C.
 metro area, you can choose washingtonpost.com/regional to see
 a larger set of headlines under Local News  that looks like
 this:

<p>
Don&rsquo;t worry; on washingtonpost.com/regional you&rsquo;ll
 still get the same national/international news and all of our
 most popular opinions and blogs. The Opinions columns, for instance,
 have simply moved down a notch as you can see here:

<p>
We also realize there may be some of you who live in the Washington,
 D.C . metro area who might not want, or be interested in, even
 more local news. If so, you will have a choice to select your
 homepage &mdash; one with more prominent metro area headlines
 or our U.S. edition. You can also switch between the two as
 often as you like by simply picking one of the two editions
 on the top left of your homepage here:

<p>
Registered readers can go to &ldquo;Manage Your Profile&rdquo;
 to select a homepage preference &mdash; National homepage or
 National/Local homepage. Once you select your preference, you&rsquo;ll
 automatically be sent to your preferred homepage when you log
 into washingtonpost.com.

<p>We hope that by giving you more choices in how you read what
 you want to read, we are making it easier for you to find what
 interests you most. We continue to work on making our overall
 Web site faster and easier, and this is one of the steps along
 the way.

<p>Please let us know if you have any questions, comments or suggestions
 by writing to us at ideas@washpost.com.

<p>Update:We are continuing to work on technical issues that may
 prevent readers from consistently getting the page of their
 choice. We will update this post when those issues are resolved.

<p>If you are having problems with the &ldquo;edition toggle,&rdquo;
 it may be that you previously selected another homepage as your
 default. To undo that:

<l>&bull; Make sure you&rsquo;re logged in to washingtonpost.com.

<l>&bull; Click on your registered log-in name at the top of the
 homepage.

<l>&bull; Click on Homepage Selection.

<l>&bull; Make National homepage your default and click update to
 save your selection. Then, if you choose, select National/Local
 homepage to make this your homepage.

<p>Update (Dec. 6): This issue has been fixed. The toggle button
 near the top left of the home page does not work for registered
 users who use Firefox or Chome as their Internet browser and
 have the National/Local home page selected as their preference.
 To fix it, click on your username at the top of the home page,
 select &ldquo;Homepage Selection | Network News Preferences&rdquo;
 and change your preferred home page to &ldquo;National homepage.&rdquo;
 You will no longer be automatically redirected to the local
 version of the page, but the toggle button will work.
