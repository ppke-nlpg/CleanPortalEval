<h>Watch: Steve Case discusses the &#8216;second Internet revolution&#8217;

<p>In a Web-exclusive Afternoon Mo&#039; Joe greenroom interview,
 Startup America Partnership chairman Steve Case talks to MSNBC&#039;s
 Richard Wolffe about the next trends in technology and how to
 encourage innovators to stay in America.

<p>Since technology has become a major part of people&#8217;s daily
 lives, the co-founder of America Online now has his eyes focused
 on the so-called &#8220;second Internet revolution.&#8221;

<p>In an Afternoon Mo&#8217; Joe greenroom interview, Steve Case
 told MSNBC&#8217;s Richard Wolffe that the next trend in technology
 focuses on the creation of companies that use the Internet to
 disrupt other industries and help entrepreneurs advance their
 innovative ideas.

<p>The best and brightest individuals in the world have always been
 attracted to America, said Case, who has argued in the past
 that a comprehensive immigration resolution should include extra
 visas that will assist in the creation of jobs.

<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re going to remain the most entrepreneurial
 nation with the strongest economy, we&#8217;ve got to be the
 most innovative nation,&#8221; said Case, an entrepreneur, philanthropist,
 and pioneer in making the Internet part of everyday life. &#8220;Technology
 obviously plays a role in that.&#8221;

<p>The challenge is to maintain the interests of individuals in
 danger of leaving the country to establish competing companies
 in other nations.

<p>Case is currently the chairman of the Startup America Partnership
 which aims to celebrate and accelerate entrepreneurship.
