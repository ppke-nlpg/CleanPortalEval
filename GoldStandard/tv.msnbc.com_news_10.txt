<h>IRS official takes the 5th: &#8216;I have not done anything wrong&#8217;

 House Oversight Committee hearing to investigate the extra scrutiny
 IRS gave to Tea Party and other conservative groups that applied
 for tax-exempt status. Lerner told the committee she did nothing
 wrong and then invoked her constitutional right to not answer

<p>Lois Lerner is pleading the fifth.

<p>The IRS official who heads the tax-exempt division at the Internal
 Revenue Service exercised her right to not testify as a witness
 against herself at a House Oversight committee hearing on the
 IRS&#8217; past targeting of conservative groups.

<p>Lerner on Wednesday  insisted, however, that &#8220;I have not
 done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not
 violated any IRS rules or regulations and I have not provided
 false information to this or any other congressional committee.&#8221;

<p>She acknowledged that &#8220;some people will assume that I have
 done something wrong. I have not&#8221; and that she was taking
 the advice of her legal counsel.

<p>News surfaced earlier this month that the tax collecting agency
 had wrongly targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt
 statues for extra scrutiny, including the Tea Party, 18 months
 before the 2012 election. The revelations led to the resignation
 of acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller and Joseph Grant, commissioner
 of the IRS’ tax exempt and government entities division.

<p>President Obama&#8211;who has said he was unaware of the IRS&#8217;
 practice&#8211;has promised to hold other IRS officials accountable
 and work with Congress to make sure “this doesn’t happen
 again.”

<p>In June 2011, Lerner learned at a meeting that conservative groups
 were being targeted, according to the inspector general report.
 The division subsequently switched to more general search criteria.
 Six months later, she met with some members of Congress to discuss
 the issue, but didn’t bring up the targeting of conservative
 groups, according to the IG report.

<p>Lerner, two weeks ago, was the first IRS official to publicly
 acknowledge that the agency had targeted the groups, calling
 it “absolutely inappropriate.” She argued, however, that
 the motive was not political and that it was merely an effort
 to handle the influx of applications of groups seeking tax-exempt
 status. Some are calling for her resignation, and Lerner –who
 started at the IRS in 2001, has lawyered up with William W.
 Taylor III, who represented former International Monetary Fund
 head Dominique Strauss Kahn, who was accused of sexual assault.

<p>House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa asked Lerner to reconsider
 testifying, but she declined. Issa eventually dismissed Lerner
 but said she could be &#8220;subject to recall.&#8221;

<p>Lerner&#8217;s decision to take the fifth stirred up anger among
 Republican officials at the hearing.

<p>&#8220;The irony is inescapable,&#8221; said Rep. Jim Jordan
 of Ohio. &#8220;Ms. Lerner gets to exercise her constitutional
 rights but she won&#8217;t stay here and answer questions about
 the constitutional rights of thousands of Americans who were
 denied by her actions.&#8221;

<p>Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina said the committee should operate
 more like a courtroom.

<p>&#8220;You don’t get to tell your side of the story and not
 be subjected to cross examination,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That’s
 not the way it works. She waived her right to Fifth Amendment
 privilege by issuing an opening statement, she ought to stand
 here and answer our questions.&#8221;

<p>Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland countered that the
 committee in fact does not operate like a federal court room.
 Lerner &#8220;does have a right [to take plead the fifth], and
 we have to adhere to that,&#8221; said Cummings.

<p>This is the third congressional hearing on the IRS scandal. J.
 Russell George, the Treasury inspector general, former IRS Commissioner
 Douglas Shulman and Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin are
 also expected to testify on Wednesday.

<p>Watch Lerner invoke the Fifth.
