<h>Class calculator: A US view of the class system

<p>Foreigners can find Britain&#039;s class system baffling and
 fascinating. With its traditional divisions declared obsolete
 by sociologists, an American offers his take on the new seven-tier
 model.

<p>The BBC&#039;s Great British Class survey has pretty much killed
 productivity at my end of Facebook. Everyone in my network is
 taking it and laughing out loud at the results (read to the
 bottom and I&#039;ll tell you what class I&#039;m in).

<p>But beyond starting a light-hearted national conversation on
 what class in Britain is today, BBC Lab UK&#039;s attempt to
 redefine class boundaries in UK society is a worthy idea.

<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about it - particularly since
 the onset of the recession - when my "class-ification" took
 a severe knock. Pretty clearly, it is well past time for a redefinition
 of terms.

<p>When I spent a junior year abroad at Oxford University in the
 1970s, social class was defined by your origin, despite the
 faux egalitarianism of the time.

<p>Oxford students would delight in mocking others over their backgrounds

<p>Those origins had a long history. All sides played Spot the Fake
 Accent: whether it was the grammar school boy mocking the toff
 playing at being one of the ordinary lads, or the first generation
 middle-class kid being satirised for trying to sound posh. 

<p>But as with so much else in British society, a great change began
 during Margaret Thatcher&#039;s time in office. 

<p>She either - depending on your politics - "tamed the unions"
 or "made war on the unions". Either way, she caused an earthquake
 within the traditional working class.

<p>Thatcher became the patron saint of working-class strivers (as
 they would now be called) by giving council tenants the right
 to buy their homes. Anyone, regardless of background, could
 buy shares in the flotation of previously nationalised industries.
 A property-owning, shareholding society - and open to all -
 was her vision. "Tell Sid" was the ad slogan for British Gas
 shares, not "Tell Rupert" or "Tell his Lordship".

<p>Money, which had really not featured in the British demarcation
 of social class, became very important. This was a huge change.
 Comics and satirists had a field day creating characters like
 Harry Enfield&#039;s Loadsamoney. Caryl Churchill won major
 awards on both sides of the Atlantic with her play Serious Money,
 in which the "oiks" in the City of London take over from the
 gents. 

<p>This was around the time I moved to Britain permanently from
 the US. 

<p>Interestingly, even as Thatcher was working to open things up
 and making the British class system more like America&#039;s,
 the US class system started becoming more and more rigid.

<p>The Right to Buy policy turned working class families into homeowners

<p>Today, one of the few things US politicians on the right and
 the left agree on is social mobility in their country has calcified.
 It is actually lower than in Britain, as the New York Times
 noted last year.

<p>Why it took so long to figure this out is beyond me. It&#039;s
 been clear since the 1970s that the class system was becoming
 more inflexible.

<p>The great upthrust of the immigrant working class into the middle
 class after World War II, via the GI Bill, was stopped stone
 cold by the events of the autumn of 1973, when the October war
 in the Middle East led to the quadrupling of oil prices virtually
 overnight and the great inflation set in.

<p>Personal testimony: my father was a clinical professor at a Philadelphia
 medical school. He made a very nice living. Like seeks like,
 and we lived in a neighbourhood of doctors, lawyers, executives,
 stockbrokers and successful entrepreneurs. You had to work hard
 to fall out of that class.

<p>Plenty of my school fellows did just OK in high school, went
 to second-rank universities, where they majored in having a
 good time, crammed for the LSAT (law school test) and squeezed
 into second-rank law schools or business schools. 

<p>They emerged on the other side with a credential that allowed
 them to make a pretty good living without putting themselves
 out too much. A young man from an inner-city school in Philadelphia
 who took the same relaxed approach to study and career would
 never have made it to law school or business school.

<p>It was entirely likely that young man had brushes with the law
 and possibly ended up in prison, as a look at incarceration
 rates for 18- to 25-year-old African American males in the 70s
 and 80s will confirm. And if you were white and working class,
 listen to the songs of Bruce Springsteen to get a sense of the
 frustrations.

<p>What will get you into Harvard?

<p>What was true almost 40 years ago is even more true today. As
 many as 15% of white students admitted to elite colleges don&#039;t
 meet admissions standards. They do meet a more important requirement
 - their parents are alumni or big donors, according to the Boston
 Globe. 

<p>In Britain we call this the class system at work. But it still
 leaves the work of redefining social class. 

<h>More US views on class in Britain

<p>US historian Dr Tim Stanley summed up the difference between
 social status in the US and UK for the Daily Telegraph: "To
 Americans, social status is all about money and power. To Brits
 it is all about birth and accent."

<p>Slate says American concern about inequality is soothed by Downton
 Abbey: "There is in the show&#039;s popularity some quality
 of nostalgia for a class structure we never had. We don&#039;t
 wholly approve of it... but are somehow entranced."

<p>The Atlantic notes: "The calculator is distinctly British. Part
 of the questionnaire, for example, asks if you regularly &#039;go
 to stately homes&#039;. Answering yes instantly increases your
 cultural capital."

<p>The problem is how do you factor in money. What does it measure
 in terms of class? Should it be the sole arbiter of class? And
 if it is, what do mega-events like the crash of 2008 do to the
 class structure?

<p>Anyway, if you&#039;ve read this far you would probably peg me
 as upper middle class, kind of privileged. My CV would verify
 that impression, yet, according to the BBC survey, I am a member
 of the "precariat". Well, no kidding. I&#039;m a freelance journalist.
 

<p>Although once upon a time I had a staff job with all the appurtenances.
 Had I filled out the questionnaire seven years ago, I would
 have been categorised as either "established middle class" or
 "new affluent" because back then I could afford to go to the
 theatre regularly and went to dinner at posh restaurants.

<p>I had a much wider circle of acquaintances. If you can&#039;t
 go out to the pub, or if you&#039;re feeling low because money
 is so tight, you just lose touch with people. Going out, a wide
 circle of acquaintances - cultural capital and social capital
 - are key factors in determining your social class, according
 to the survey. 

<p>Instead, I am in the "precariat", which means I am likely to
 come from a working class background. No, I don&#039;t, although
 I suppose my daughter will be typed that way. Mind you, I don&#039;t
 feel alone on my downwardly mobile path. On both sides of the
 Atlantic, I know plenty of people who are in my position - successful
 wage earners thrown out of work for the apostasy of turning
 50. Today we work as freelancers or consultants. It&#039;s a
 fast growing category, according to the New York Times.

<p>Are we still middle class? Probably. So are there three social
 classes or seven or 100?

<p>Maybe, given the uncertainty of the contemporary economy, we
 should keep everything fluid and paraphrase Supreme Court Justice
 Potter Stewart&#039;s definition of obscenity by saying when
 it comes to define middle class, working class, upper class
 or precariat class: "I know it when I see it."
