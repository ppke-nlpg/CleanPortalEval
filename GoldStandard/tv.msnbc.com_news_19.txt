<h>#Click3: The greatest from the world wide web

<p>Mother Jones offers a great graphic that answers the question
 “Is your team’s owner a ‘Major League A-hole?”; Mark
 Bittman has a great New York Times piece about the healthy fast
 food movement; and BuzzFeed has a great list out telling you
 who the hottest attorneys general are.

<p>The All In with Chris Hayes team puts out a daily call to the
 Twitter and Facebook communities for the “awesomest things”
 they encountered on the Internet.

<p>1.  Following a ruling that determined the New York Yankees
 baseball team has the exclusive rights to the phrase &#8220;Baseball&#8217;s
 Evil Empire,&#8221; Mother Jones undertook the admirable effort
 to document the owners of all major league baseball teams, which
 resulted in &#8220;Is Your Team&#8217;s Owner a Major League
 Asshole?&#8221; The matrix makes the Yankees, in spite of their
 trademark, look like kittens.  Thanks to Twitter fan Jennie
 Brand who pointed us to this.

<p>2. New York Times writer Mark Bittman, in his latest column,
 has documented the efforts of small fast food chains to offer
 their customers healthy, humane, and cheap food.

<p>3. Buzzfeed seized on President Obama&#8217;s remarks concerning
 the physical appearance of California&#8217;s attorney-general
 Kamala Harris. We didn&#8217;t know what we were missing until
 Buzzfeed&#8217;s Rosie Gray compiled The 13 Hottest Attorneys-General.
