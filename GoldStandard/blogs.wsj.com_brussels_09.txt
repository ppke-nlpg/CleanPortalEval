<h>EU Admits Austerity Risk For Jobs

<p>A new report released by the European Commission late last week
 underlines the devastating consequences of the financial crisis
 on youth employment, and acknowledged the difficulty in implementing
 policies to alleviate this crisis as the European Union focuses
 on austerity.

<p>“Young people remain the hardest hit by the crisis and its
 aftermath,” says the report, and the faltering recovery is
 expected to make things worse.

<p>“In short, income shocks may prove permanent and income losses
 at the bottom of the distribution can be persistent.”

<p>The consequences can be long-term scarring for youth, with future
 employability and earnings at risk. The EU report also concludes
 that the risks of long-term exclusion from the labor market
 and society are increasing for the jobless.

<p>The EU in the past two years has added only a net 1.5 million
 jobs in the total population, compared to the 6 million jobs
 lost during the recession. Youth unemployment has risen to 20%
 in the EU and is above 25% in 10 Member States, with a high
 of 48% in Spain. And, another recession is coming, which will
 almost certainly undermine any economic recovery, amid a slowdown
 in world trade and the protracted euro crisis.

<p>“As the economic context remains difficult, governments’
 fiscal space will remain very tight with little prospect of
 increased levels of social spending,” says the report. Social
 protection measures during the height of the crisis did actually
 help stabilize household incomes, it says.

<p>The limited ability to provide further support, though, comes
 after the crisis “massively” destroyed medium-paid jobs
 in manufacturing and construction and as employers are becoming
 more demanding about education and skills levels.

<p>This is not only “compromising the chances” for lower-skilled
 people to regain employment. In addition, educated workers don’t
 meet the demands of the new high-skilled jobs, which seek different
 kinds of educational backgrounds. Germany is famous for this
 problem.

<p>On top of that, in-work poverty is increasing in Europe with
 the rise of temporary job contracts, which put young people
 most at risk. In Germany, Slovenia, France and Sweden most temporary
 contracts are concentrated among the young. Temporary contracts
 on average carry a 14% wage penalty relative to permanent jobs.
 So even though a country like Germany has among the lowest youth
 unemployment rates in the EU at about 9%, this masks a growing
 risk. Moreover, mobility between temporary and permanent contracts
 is not high in Europe, says the report, so that low-wage work
 can become a persistent feature of a person’s working life.

<p>The report also highlights that member states with high income
 inequality were usually harder hit by the crisis. The four most
 unequal countries in the EU-15 are Portugal, Greece, the U.K.
 and Spain, based on 2009 data.

<p>The EU says that measures that would increase income inequality
 include cuts to benefits like education and healthcare, cuts
 in social transfers, and an increase in consumption or value
 added taxes—all measures being undertaken in parts of Europe.
