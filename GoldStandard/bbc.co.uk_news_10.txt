<h>Banking on nuclear peace in Kazakhstan

<p>"We live in a gas chamber," says Denis Danielevsky, pointing at
 several smoking chimney stacks on a hill overlooking a huge
 industrial area in the town of Ust-Kamenogorsk, eastern Kazakhstan.

<p>Mr Danielevsky is the editor of a local independent newspaper. 

<p>It has been writing about the Kazakh government&#039;s plans to host
 a nuclear fuel bank under UN control at Ulba metallurgy plant. 

<p>It was once a top secret Soviet facility but today it is the
 biggest uranium production factory in Kazakhstan.

<p>"The air quality is very bad here and any project with the word
 nuclear causes a negative reaction among people," says Mr
 Danielevsky. 

<p>But the government of Kazakhstan has a different view. In 2009
 President Nursultan Nazarbayev offered to host a nuclear fuel bank
 under the International Atomic Energy Agency&#039;s jurisdiction.

<p>The project is aimed at encouraging countries like Iran not to
 pursue their own uranium enrichment technologies. 

<p>Instead client countries would have a guaranteed access to low
 enriched uranium to fuel civil nuclear reactors.

<h>Pride in non-proliferation

<p>Formal negotiations between the IAEA and Kazakhstan began last year. 

<p>An IAEA delegation visited the proposed site in Ust-Kamenogorsk and
 made a number of recommendations to the government of Kazakhstan.

<p>The bank would provide low-enriched uranium to countries for energy purposes

<p>"Taking into account that the plant will be operating under
 international standards the impact on the environment and public
 health will be practically zero," says the chairman of
 Kazakhstan&#039;s atomic energy committee Temir Zhantikin.

<p>"The Ulba plant has been working for more than 60 years in this
 field and they have high standards for nuclear safety and
 security. 

<p>"We never thought about commercial preferences because the project is
 mainly aimed at nuclear non-proliferation."

<p>Kazakhstan&#039;s leadership prides itself on its history of
 non-proliferation: in 1991 the country shut down the Soviet
 Union&#039;s main nuclear testing site at Semipalatinsk. Over four
 decades more than 450 nuclear tests were carried out there.

<p>The country also voluntarily gave up a huge nuclear weapons arsenal
 inherited after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

<p>Last year, Kazakhstan became the world&#039;s top uranium producer.
 Hosting the multinational talks on Iran&#039;s nuclear programme and
 talking up the nuclear fuel bank has boosted Kazakhstan&#039;s
 image as a suitable peace broker.

<h>'Chicken and egg'

<p>Opponents of the bank are worried about the potential impact on the environment

<p>But subscribing to a nuclear fuel bank has so far not been on the
 negotiating table between UN Security Council members, Germany and
 Iran. 

<p>"Until you get a specific resolution on the Iranian issue and remove
 that off the table you are not going to get onto the general
 point of discussion on the bank. It becomes a chicken and egg
 thing," Professor Scott Lucas, a specialist on Iran from Birmingham
 University, says. 

<p>Last September, IAEA Director General Yukia Amano said that work to
 establish a low enriched uranium bank in Kazakhstan "continued to
 make progress". 

<p>But there has been no deadline set for establishing the bank nor is
 it clear which countries are willing to sign up to it. 

<p>Four years since Kazakhstan announced its willingness to host the
 bank the people of Ust-Kamenogorsk may not have to worry just
 yet. 

<p>Without any breakthrough in the deadlock over Iran&#039;s own nuclear
 enrichment programme the nuclear fuel bank looks likely for now to
 remain an idea rather than a concrete step towards world peace.
