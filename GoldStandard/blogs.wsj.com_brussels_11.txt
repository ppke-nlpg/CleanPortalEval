<h>European Parliament: The Video Game

<p>Members of the European Parliament debate at the European Parliament
 in Strasbourg.

<p>The European Union has a long history of dumping mountains of
 cash on communications projects in an effort to:

<l>Make itself more popular and better known among EU citizens.
 This has led to such campaigns as “Europe is Bling,” an
 online trivia game hosted by a (fictional) white European rapper
 named Mr. Bling who rapped &#8220;Me like Europe. Europe is
 bling. Bling!&#8221; Last year, there was “Can EU hear me?,”
 an effort to promote lagging participation in elections to the
 European Parliament through mass gatherings of young people
 in sexy European capitals.

<l>Educate Europeans about the mysteries of its functioning and
 process. Thus the births of the EU’s YouTube channel and European
 Parliament television.

<p>One way of doing both, EU officials say, is to develop video
 games, such as Euro Kids’ Corner.

<p>Enter a half-dozen Brussels-based media and communication companies
 who derive all or a substantial part of their profits from the
 EU’s €268 million annual communications budget. One of them,
 the European Services Network, has received a €275,000 contract
 to develop and online Second Life-style interactive game called
 Citzalia.

<p>The game will take players through the hallways of European Parliament
 offices in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg. As is the tradition
 in such pastimes, players can use their avatars to do everything
 from choosing flowers and furniture to debating the effects
 of climate change.

<p>It&#8217;s still in its developmental stage, ESN says. You, dear
 EU political junkie, can now take part and offer feedback. ESN
 staff say the game is not designed for gaming teenagers but
 for serious students of EU policy.

<p>UPDATE: Ahmed ElAmin, the site’s project editor, called to
 clarify a few points about Citzalia. “People are calling it
 a game,” he says. “But it’s not, it’s a simulation of
 how the parliament works and a forum for readers to debate ideas
 about the parliament and the EU.”

<p>ESN is paying a quarter of the costs and is using the project
 as a kind of marketing venture, he adds. “We’re not making
 any money from this. We want to show the skills and thinking
 outside the box that we’re capable of.”
