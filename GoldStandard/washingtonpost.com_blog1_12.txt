<h>The Gun Moment: Behind WP Magazine&#8217;s recent coverage

<p>The cover story for Sunday&#8217;s Washington Post magazine
 took a compelling look at the lingering effects of violence. The
 story, by reporter Neely Tucker, takes a reader back 46 years
 to the night of Friday, Jan. 20, 1967 &#8212; the night Edward
 Kenneth Vessels shot his wife, Fran, with a 12-gauge shotgun.

<p>Tucker deconstructs what led to the events of that night, but
 perhaps more importantly, what happened in the aftermath. How
 did it affect the Vessels family? What happened to the couple&#8217;s
 six children?

<p>The Vesselses&#8217; story could easily be ruled an extreme case,
 but a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that
 one in five Americans has a connection to a victim of gun violence.
 As noted by Wonkblog&#8217;s Sarah Kliff, the same poll revealed
 that Americans are more worried about being a victim of gun
 violence than losing their jobs &#8212; a striking statement
 on the heels of an economic downturn.

<p>The idea that many Americans are touched by gun violence is the
 theme of another article in the March 10 edition of the magazine.
 (Read: How many people do you know who have been shot?) Articles
 editor Joe Heim drew on a personal experience to examine the
 lives of people affected by gun violence. After a grad school
 acquaintance of Heim&#8217;s was shot and killed, a friend took
 to Facebook to say that they now knew nine people who had been
 shot (either killed or wounded). Then he posed an interesting
 question: What&#8217;s your number?

<p>People responded with their own stories of how they or their
 loved ones had been affected by gun violence. &#8220;It was
 a powerful thing to read,&#8221; said Heim, who took the idea
 to his fellow magazine editors. One suggested that Heim go around
 the Washington area to find out how many times locals&#8217;
 lives had been touched by gun violence.

<p>Heim said that while stories on gun violence are often policy-driven
 or focused on the immediate aftermath of an incident, Post editors
 wanted his story to be different. &#8220;We wanted to take it
 out of the political debate and put the focus back on the lives
 of people who had been affected by gun violence,&#8221; Heim
 said.

<p>Both Tucker&#8217;s and Heim&#8217;s stories struck magazine
 editors as relevant, particularly in the wake of the Newtown
 tragedy. &#8220;Newtown is such a national conversation,&#8221;
 said Lynn Medford, editor of the magazine and the Post&#8217;s
 Sunday Style section. &#8220;Between the two [stories], you
 cover a lot of territory on gun violence, from suicide to domestic
 violence.&#8221;

<p>Heim said he interviewed between 50 and 60 local residents to
 find out how they had been affected by gun violence. And while
 he never mentioned Newtown, the majority of people he talked
 to brought it up. &#8220;It was certainly something that was
 on everyone&#8217;s mind,&#8221; he said.

<p>Tucker said he began working on his story well before the Newtown
 shootings. He began research for the article last year, after
 one of the Vessels daughters, Lynnie, reached out to him about
 a book she&#8217;d written, detailing how the incident had affected
 her life. Something Tucker wrote had resonated with Lynnie &#8212;
 his two-part story, &#8220;Life After Death,&#8221; explored
 the despair his wife Carol Smith experienced following the murder
 of her daughter, Erika, who was shot and killed in 2002 at the
 age of nine. The article also chronicled Smith&#8217;s multi-year
 fight for justice.

<p>From these and other stories about people affected by gun violence,
 there emerged a theme, Medford noted: &#8220;Your life changes,
 and it never changes back.&#8221;
