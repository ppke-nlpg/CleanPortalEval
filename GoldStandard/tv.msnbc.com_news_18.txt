<h>America in the dark about laws governing the war on terror

<p>Hawaii House candidate Tulsi Gabbard shares her thoughts on the
 conversation about Afghanistan at the Democratic National Convention,
 and the Up panel discusses whether or not Mitt Romney would
 be ready to handle the President’s “kill list.”

<p>It&#8217;s not just the Obama administration&#8217;s counter-terrorism
 activities which are shrouded in secret; the very legal framework
 for those activities is highly classified. To put it another
 way, the American people have no way of knowing what the White
 House believes it is empowered to do in the name of keeping
 them safe.

<p>On Sunday&#8217;s Up with Chris Hayes, investigative journalist
 Jeremy Scahill said he had recently spoken to Senator Ron Wyden
 (D-OR) about this two-tiered legal structure. Wyden &#8220;said
 the American people would be shocked if they were allowed to
 access the administration&#8217;s interpretation of the same
 laws that the American people can read publicly,&#8221; said
 Scahill, a reporter for The Nation. &#8220;In other words,
 Wyden said, there are two sets of laws in this country: One
 that the American people are allowed to read, and then one which
 exists in secret, which is the administration&#8217;s interpretations
 of those laws.&#8221;

<p>This is not the first time Wyden has brought attention to the
 Obama administration&#8217;s secret legal interpretations. In
 May 2011, as Congress was preparing to renew the PATRIOT Act,
 he revealed the existence of what became known as the &#8220;secret
 PATRIOT Act&#8220;: the Obama administration&#8217;s classified
 interpretation of that law, which Wyden said grants them far
 more expansive powers than Congress or the public could have
 ever anticipated. Cato Institute research fellow Julian Sanchez,
 an expert in privacy issues, believes the secret interpretation
 &#8220;probably involves some form of cellular phone geolocation
 tracking, potentially on a large scale.&#8221;

<p>The legal regime governing extrajudicial killings is also secret.
 The Obama administration has long maintained that it has the
 authority to order the assassination of suspected terrorists—including
 American citizens—without any judicial oversight. Allegedly,
 American drones have killed three American citizens in Yemen,
 including a seventeen-year-old boy. However, when the ACLU sued
 the Justice Department to obtain the memo that would legally
 justify one of those killings, the government replied that
 it had never &#8221;officially acknowledged&#8221; the existence
 of any such memo, and furthermore that it had &#8221;neither
 confirmed nor denied&#8221; the existence of a targeted killing
 program.

<p>Scahill said he asked Wyden, a member of the Senate Intelligence
 Committee, about the targeted killing program. &#8220;They&#8217;re
 supposed to be briefed about many of these sensitive operations,&#8221;
 Scahill said. &#8220;I was asking him about this process for
 how an American citizen ends up on a kill list. And what Wyden
 was saying was that he believes that the Intelligence Committee
 hasn&#8217;t had that fully explained to these people with these
 special security clearances.&#8221; Whereas Wyden had access
 to the secret PATRIOT Act, the full scope of the law governing
 targeted killings may be secret even to him.
