<h>Living legends of civil rights on the struggles of the past,
 and the future

<p>Rev. Joseph Lowery and Juanita Abernathy, widow of Rev. Ralph
 Abernathy, join Rev. Al Sharpton to talk about their experiences
 in the civil right movement and how far they think the country
 has come.

<p>As the nation honors Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the 45th anniversary
 of his death, visiting his memorial in Washington can be hard
 for many&#8211;especially anyone who didn&#8217;t live through
 the 1960&#8242;s civil rights movement&#8211;to realize just
 how controversial civil rights leaders like Dr. King, Rosa Parks,
 and Rev. Ralph Abernathy were.

<p>But for Juanita Abernathy, Ralph&#8217;s widow, the memories
 have not faded. She joined Rev. Al Sharpton on PoliticsNation
 Friday to talk about the opposition she faced. She worked alongside
 her husband and King mobilizing support for the Montgomery Bus
 Boycott. A couple years later she and her daughter miraculously
 survived the bombing of their home that came as a retaliation
 as her husband was establishing the Southern Christian Leadership
 Conference with King. The struggle did not end there.

<p>&#8220;We had death threats every day for five consecutive years,&#8221;
 she said.

<p>She recalls that people from a white supremacist group would
 call her home all day long, starting at seven in the morning,
 every day. &#8220;It was constant,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Rosa
 Parks and my house, we got the calls.&#8221;

<p>The messages were not subtle. &#8220;They cursed and called us
 everything, &#8216;We&#8217;re going to blow your so-n-so head
 off and your little children,&#8217;&#8221; she said.

<p>Those experiences made it so much more rewarding to see Barack
 Obama take office.

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to realize that in those days we talked
 about a black president but really we weren&#8217;t sure we&#8217;d
 ever live to see one,&#8221; said Rev. Joseph Lowery. He worked
 alongside Abernathy and her husband for years, eventually running
 the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He didn&#8217;t
 just live to see first black president, he also participated
 in his first inauguration, giving the benediction.

<p>Abernathy agreed. &#8220;We knew one day it would happen, but
 not in our lifetime,&#8221; she said.

<p>Her advice to the civil rights leaders of today and tomorrow?
 &#8220;Faith in God, number one, and determination, and be sure
 of your goals and aspirations and pursue them untiringly until
 they&#8217;re accomplished,&#8221; she said. &#8221;Because
 it isn&#8217;t going to be easy, but if you pursue it and continually
 work at it, you will be successful.&#8221;
