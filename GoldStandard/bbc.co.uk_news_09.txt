<h>The start-ups that favour New York over Silicon Valley

<p>New York&#039;s start-up scene has been booming, with the sector
 creating more than 10,000 jobs in the city over the past five
 years. Some talk of Silicon Alley as being a credible rival
 to its west coast counterpart. 

<p>But what quickly emerges when you speak to those involved in
 New York&#039;s start-ups is how they are focused on solving
 specific everyday problems rather than Silicon Valley&#039;s
 broader game-shifting approach.

<p>Take New Yorker Roger Wu. He knows that we care about the opinions
 of our friends. 

<p>He also believes that we go to different friends for different
 advice, and that we could benefit from integrating this with
 social media.

<p>He aims to make this happen with his start-up ShopMine, which
 analyses Pinterest accounts and helps users know which of their
 friends to turn to for recommendations on specific products
 and services.

<p>It's easy in the Valley to get caught in this echo chamber of
 what's happening within technology&rdquo;

<p>In 2007 Wu travelled to the San Francisco Bay Area to see if
 he should base his start-up dreams out there, but soon returned
 east.

<p>"I think here there&#039;s more of a business mind-set," he says,
 "as opposed to creating technology for the sake of it and then
 figuring out what market there is."

<h>Silicon Alley's ambitions

<p>Many of New York&#039;s tech entrepreneurs strongly believe that
 the city&#039;s diversity of people and industries is one of
 its key assets for attracting top talent and creating new and
 successful start-ups. 

<p>"In New York there are so many different industries that are
 the &#039;it&#039; industry," Wu explains, citing finance, fashion,
 advertising and media as a few examples.

<p>He says this beats the "tight knit clique" of tech found in Silicon
 Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area, and means that New York&#039;s
 start-ups are more consumer-focused.

<p>Wu also believes that this means funding is more readily available
 for a wider range of ventures. 

<p>Roger Wu believes New York&#039;s start-ups are more consumer
 focused

<p>Out of the country&#039;s half dozen leading technology cities,
 New York has been the only one to see an increase in venture
 capital deals, which have risen by 32% since 2007.

<h>Unique flavours

<p>Down the road in Soho, David Haber works at venture capital firm
 Spark Capital.

<p>Local companies it&#039;s invested in often have a specific focus,
 such as 1stDibs, an online marketplace for antiques and vintage
 goods, and the popular glasses e-retailer Warby Parker. 

<p>Warby Parker make trendy vintage inspired glasses, selling them
 complete with prescription lenses for $95 (£59), compared to
 the $300 (£186) or upwards that&#039;s often charged for a
 pair of spectacles.

<p>The company provides a service where consumers can choose five
 glasses online to be mailed home for free, before selecting
 a pair to buy. 

<p>Customers can also load their photo onto its website and try
 on different glasses that way.

<p>Mr Haber says it is typical of New York companies that make the
 most of technological innovations, but do not allow them to
 become their focus.

<p> "It&#039;s easy in the Valley to get caught in this echo chamber
 of what&#039;s happening within technology," he says.

<h>Needing people to grow

<p>New York&#039;s has seen a thousand new start-ups over the past
 five years

<p>Some of the city&#039;s start-uppers come from a variety of non-tech
 or business backgrounds and apply these experiences to very
 specific problems.

<p>Jonathan Block spent years in the music industry, managing the
 bands G Love and the Special Sauce, and the Fun Lovin&#039;
 Criminals.

<p>He is now turning his attention to disrupting the music merchandise
 space through his soon to be launched venture TheHub.fm. 

<p>"There is one aspect of the music industry that has never changed
 or been disrupted in a helpful or positive manner," Block explains,
 "That is, specifically, the sale of merchandise."

<p>TheHub.fm aims to make the sale and supply of music merchandise
 more efficient. 

<p>Block says that the current system often leaves fans in long
 queues only to be left empty handed once merchandise in their
 size and colour runs out. 

<p>Bands also lose money on these lost sales. 

<p>Marker wants people to share places they love with their friends

<p>He aims to use mobile technology to make this transaction more
 efficient for both parties.

<p>Block is focused on a particular problem, but he believes solving
 it involves speaking to a wide range of potential clients -
 and New York&#039;s melting pot offers the perfect opportunity
 to hone his ideas.

<p>"If you want to grow in business you need to continuously be
 meeting new people," he says.

<h>California dreamin'

<p>However, New York&#039;s focus on targeting specific problems
 doesn&#039;t suit everyone. 

<p>San Francisco Bay Area native Michael Molesky spent a year and
 a half in New York developing his venture Marker, before moving
 back home. 

<p>The online service aims to allow individuals to share places
 which they love with their friends and followers. 

<p>While he was based in New York he travelled back home frequently
 and had conversations with people in both locations about his
 project.

<p>"People in San Francisco really saw the vision more," he says.

<p>"New Yorkers tend to be a lot more competitive whereas people
 in Silicon Valley, I think of them as more ambitious." 

<p>He is sceptical that New York&#039;s tightly focused start-ups
 can have a deep influence in society.

<p>Instead, he says, paradigm shifts require Silicon Valley&#039;s
 mentality of "thinking big thoughts and attacking big problems",
 and people who are "dreamers". 

<p>"The companies that have really shifted the way we think about
 technology and media have consistently been based out here in
 California," he adds.
