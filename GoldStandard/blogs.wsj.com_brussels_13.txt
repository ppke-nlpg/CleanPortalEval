<h>Week Ahead: April 29 to May 3

<p>European institutions are set to enjoy a bit of a break next
 week, as the May 1 holiday on Wednesday will slow work. But
 the few events scheduled will be key to understanding the state
 of the European Union&#8217;s economy.

<p>Here&#8217;s a list:

<p>Monday, the European Commission&#8217;s task force working on
 Greece will present its fourth-quarter report. &#8220;The report
 describes the assistance provided by the task force, the member
 states, international organisations and other specialist bodies
 to support Greece in the implementation of comprehensive program
 of reforms,&#8221; the commission explained. It should give
 a sense of where things are headed in the country that risked
 putting an end to the single currency.

<p>Tuesday, the two top EU VIPs &#8211;European Commission President
 Jose Manuel Barroso and the President of the EU Council, Herman
 Van Rompuy&#8211; will be in the Netherlands to celebrate the
 investiture of King Willem-Alexander.

<p>Wednesday is a bank holiday &#8212; European Labor Day (known
 in some quarters as International Workers&#8217; Day).

<p>Thursday, Mr. Van Rompuy will be in Portugal, where he will meet
 the president and the prime minister.

<p>Friday will be THE day: The commission will present its spring
 economic forecast, its regular outlook for the economy, by country.
 The forecast is crucial because it will form the basis of the
 commission&#8217;s oversight of the bloc&#8217;s economic reforms
 and its recommendations to national governments.
