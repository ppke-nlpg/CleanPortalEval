<h>Carbon Voting Gets Dirty

<p>These signs were hanging from parliament membersâ€™ door handles
 in Strasbourg. They were put there by the International Paper
 Co., which said it agreed with the climate-change fighting scheme,
 but not the proposed fix intended to raise carbon emission prices.

<p>European Parliament was gearing up to vote Wednesday on whether
 to rejuvenate, or let lie fallow, its flagship climate-change
 fighting policy, the Emissions Trading System.

<p>Shortly beforehand, the outcome remained too close to call with
 any definitive certainty. Again. The legislation is a compromise
 on what parliament very narrowly shot down in April.

<p>For those members of parliament having difficulties making the
 decision this time around, there was no shortage of opinions
 being pushed.

<p>MEPs, by all accounts all 766 of them, showed up to the office
 Monday with a hotel-style sign hanging from their office door
 handles by International Paper Co.  &#8220;Do as you are told!&#8221;
 said the tear-drop sign featuring a full mug shot of Connie
 Hedegaard, European commissioner for climate action.

<p>&#8220;The Climate Action Commissioner refused to accept your
 democratic decision and is now telling you to compromise your
 principles,&#8221; it said. &#8220;The choice is clear. Vote
 NO again to preserve your political credibility.&#8221;

<p>The effort was condemned by Matthias Groote, MEP in the Social
 Democratic party who heads the parliament&#8217;s environment
 committee. &#8220;I&#8217;m okay with lobbying,&#8221; Mr. Groote
 said. &#8220;Everybody has a right to share their opinions.
 It&#8217;s part of the democratic process.&#8221;

<p>&#8220;But this is not fair. We work very hard. To simplify it
 like this is a lie,&#8221; Mr. Groote said.

<p>An International Paper spokesman said the company supports the
 ETS scheme, just not the proposed fix.

<p>The proposal, known as backloading, is intended to lift the cost
 of emitting carbon-dioxide, which collapsed alongside the drop
 in demand for electricity during the economic downturn. The
 lack of industrial activity resulted in too many carbon permits
 in the market. The new rules would temporarily reduce this oversupply.

<p>The higher prices anticipated from this could help reintroduce
 incentives for cutting the use of fossil fuels and developing
 renewable technologies.

<p>But the fix is technical and not easy to understand. Analysts
 have said it probably won&#8217;t raise carbon prices enough
 to have an impact. Yet without this attempt at reform, the EU&#8217;s
 carbon market will almost certainly fall into obscurity, while
 California, Australia, and even China race ahead with their
 own carbon markets.

<p>So just how close will this vote be? About as close as the last
 one. In April parliament voted 334 to 315, with 63 abstentions.

<p>This was so close for a parliamentary vote that the a whole host
 of variables could have shifted it, including nothing to due
 with climate or industry at all, said Jerzy Buzek, EPP member
 and former prime minister of Poland, who is against backloading.

<p>The vote in April &#8220;was just one day before the funeral
 of Margaret Thatcher,&#8221; Mr. Buzek said, adding that if
 it had been &#8220;on the day of the funeral, backloading would
 have been approved. All the conservatives would have gone to
 London, and the result would have been quite opposite.&#8221;

<p>With no major state funerals scheduled for Wednesday, expect
 this to go to the wire.
