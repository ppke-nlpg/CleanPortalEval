<h>Groups plan fight against NC Voter ID bill

<p>Rev. William Barber, President of the North Carolina NAACP, talks
 to Up host Steve Kornacki about voting rights advocatesâ€™ legal
 and organizing strategies against a voter ID bill in North Carolina.

<p>Civil rights groups in North Carolina are already preparing to
 fight voter ID legislation that is almost certain to become
 law.

<p>On Sunday&#8217;s Up with Steve Kornacki, Rev. William Barber,
 President of the North Carolina NAACP, discussed his group&#8217;s
 plans to work with a coalition of other civil rights organizations
 to launch a two-pronged attack on the many bills that would
 restrict voting rights, particularly among low-income and minority
 voters.

<p>The measures would require photo identification at polling places
 as well as eliminate early voting and Sunday voting.

<p>It&#8217;s &#8220;the white southern strategy being revisited
 with a 21st century twist,&#8221; Barber said.

<p>He announced that activists groups would issue a call &#8220;to
 prayer, to protest, and to non-violent civil disobedience&#8221;
 Sunday night at a Durham church. He also announced that local
 clergy members and students would be staging a &#8220;pray in&#8221;
 on Monday.

<p>Rev. Barber also spoke about the coalition&#8217;s likely legal
 strategy once the bill is signed into law, one that will include
 challenges based on possible violations of the 15th and 24th
 amendments to the U.S. constitution.

<p>Watch Steve Kornacki&#8217;s full interview with Rev. Barber
 and watch Up with Steve Kornacki every Saturday and Sunday at
 8 AM.
