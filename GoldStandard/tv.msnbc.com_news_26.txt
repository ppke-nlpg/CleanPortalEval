 Up w/ Steve Kornacki to send a message to the early risers that
 take to Twitter en masse every weekend. 

<p>Steve Kornacki took time from preparations for the April 13 premiere
 of Up w/ Steve Kornacki to send a message to the early risers
 that take to Twitter to talk serious politics every weekend
 from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.

<p>The #Uppers are an essential part of what makes the show so special,
 and Kornacki knows it. “This is something that sprung up because
 this show means something to so many people who watch it,”
 he said. “They give it some kind of meaning because they’re
 getting some kind of meaning out of the show.”

<p>Watch the video, and watch Up with Steve Kornacki every Saturday
 and Sunday from 8-10.
