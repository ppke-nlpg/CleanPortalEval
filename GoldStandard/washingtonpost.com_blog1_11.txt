<h>About Wednesday&#8217;s &#8216;impressionist&#8217; front page
 photo

<p>Have you seen the front page of today&#8217;s Washington Post?
 It features an interesting photo from staff photographer Michael
 Williamson.

<p>As the caption notes, &#8220;rain on a car window makes a photo
 taken inside Tuesday look more like an impressionist painting,
 almost obscuring a pedestrian walking with an umbrella past
 rowhouses in the 600 block of East Capitol Street NE.&#8221;

<p>Williamson shared the photo on his Facebook page, telling followers:
 &#8220;Saw this view from a rainy car window and thought about
 how much it looked like an impressionist painting.&#8221;

<p>Update: Williamson called from the road to tell us more about
 the photo. He shot it with a Nikon D700, using a 28 millimeter
 lens.

<p>Williamson said getting the rain and background in the shot was
 a challenge — one that will be familiar to photography buffs.
 &#8220;It actually looks simple. It&#8217;s a tricky picture,&#8221;
 he said, noting that the key to the shot was getting the Depth
 of Field just right. Williamson&#8217;s camera lens was about
 six to eight inches from the rainy window.

<p>But he knew it was a shot worth taking, so he sat in a stopped
 car, practicing and waiting to get the perfect shot, through
 a side window.

<p>&#8220;I had the other advantage that it was a rainy day. Everybody
 saw the world that way yesterday,&#8221; Williamson said, adding
 that the photo&#8217;s setting — in Washington, D.C.&#8217;s
 Capitol Hill — resonates with people because it looks familiar
 — is it Georgetown, Paris?

<p>And while it&#8217;s an artsy shot, it follows a theme in Williamson&#8217;s
 photography, where rustic scenes often focus on texture — peeling
 paint, for example.

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a texture stalker, and the fact that the rain
 is so unpredictable and so random — it&#8217;s a photo you
 can never replicate.&#8221;

<p>On Twitter, Williamson notes that he&#8217;s often on the road
 &#8220;making photos (many with iPhone4 only) of Americana,
 breaking news &amp; funky stuff.&#8221; You can follow him there
