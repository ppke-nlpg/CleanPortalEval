<h>Military sexual assault survivors need more than sound and fury

<p>Melissa Harris-Perry’s “Open Letter” goes out to Secretary
 of Defense Chuck Hagel. She asks for real, institutional changes
 in the military that will allow victims to report crimes without
 fear of retaliation or humiliation.

<p>In the past several months, dozens of sexual assault allegations have
 emerged out of Lackland Air Force Base. That&#8217;s why it
 was particularly alarming to see a new Pentagon report out this
 week showing that alleged incidents of sexual assaults in the
 military have risen 35% over the past two years. And quite frankly,
 I was aghast to learn about how some in the military are addressing
 the problem. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m sending this week&#8217;s
 letter to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel.

<p>Dear Secretary Hagel,

<p>It&#8217;s me, Melissa.

<p>Congratulations again on your new position in the Obama administration.
 I know you have a lot on your plate between an ongoing war in
 Afghanistan and unrest in the Middle East. But I want to make
 sure that in the midst of complex international conflicts, you
 don&#8217;t forget about another crisis confronting our men
 and women in uniform every day&#8211;sexual assault in the military.

<p>I am deeply troubled by the new report from your department this
 month finding an estimated 26,000 reported cases of sexual assault
 took place in the military last year&#8211;that&#8217;s more
 than 70 instances of sexual assault every day. But what makes
 those numbers even more troubling is the other news coming out
 about how sexual assault prevention is being handled.

<p>This week the Air Force chief officer in charge of sexual assault
 prevention programs was himself arrested… for sexual battery.
 And that happened only shortly after he completed his sexual
 assault training course. I have to wonder, what was being taught
 in that course?

<p>Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel had plenty of fire in response
 to the Pentagon report on military sexual assault this week,
 but host Melissa Harris-Perry is counting concrete action from
 him.

<p>Because if it was anything like the brochure uncovered this week
 by Wired&#8216;s Spencer Ackerman, there is cause for great
 concern. The training brochure from Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter,
 South Carolina includes tips on how to avoid sexual assault,
 like &#8220;don&#8217;t walk or jog alone,&#8221; &#8220;avoid
 doorways, bushes, and alleys,&#8221; and, in the case of an
 attack, &#8220;it may be advisable to submit than to resist.&#8221;
 Do you see the pattern here? What the brochure fails to mention?
 Mr. Secretary, the sexual assault training brochure fails to
 mention to not commit sexual assault in the first place. Instead,
 it shifts the entire responsibility of preventing assaults to
 the victims.

<p>And then there&#8217;s the cases of Matthew Herrara and James
 Wilkerson, both military officials who were convicted of sexual
 assault. But because commanding officers have the power to reverse
 criminal convictions, both men had their charges dismissed &#8211;
 in one  case, against the advice of the commanding officers&#8217;
 legal team. And in both cases, no public explanation was provided
 about why convicted assaulters should be allowed to return to
 their posts.

<p>Secretary Hagel, taken by themselves, each of these incidents
 is problematic. But together they spell out a grave institutional
 failing&#8211;that, despite the attention military sexual assault
 has received in the past few years, something isn&#8217;t working.

<p>Mr. Secretary, you are to be commended for the steps you have 
already taken to address many of these issues. But sir, you gotta stay on it.

<p>We heard about the changes the military would make and the promises
 of &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; after the hallway horrors of
 the Tailhook convention in 1991, after the Aberdeen Proving
 Ground rape scandal in &#8217;96, and after the explosive reports
 of sexual assault at the Air Force Academy in &#8217;03. And
 yet, here we are again! This time it has to be different.

<p>Our service members need real, institutional changes that allow
 victims to report crimes without fear of retaliation or humiliation.
 They need a cultural shift that puts blame on the assaulters—and
 sets out real, immutable consequences determined outside the
 chain of command.

<p>And Secretary Hagel, we are counting on you to lead the change.
Sincerely,
Melissa
