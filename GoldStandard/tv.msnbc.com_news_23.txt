<h>Progressive fears confirmed with new Obama budget

<p>Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-AZ, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-NY, Sam Seder
 from The Majority Report, and Heidi Moore from The Guardian
 examine the three dueling budgets, the projected deficit under
 three budget plans, and different ways to reduce the deficit
 over 10 years.

<p>Did the conversation that happened on the March 17 episode ofÂ Up
 w/ Chris Hayes predict what would happen with President Obama&#8217;s
 budget proposal this week?

<p>On that show, host Chris Hayes sat down with Rep. Kyrsten Sinema,
 D-Ariz., podcast host Sam Seder, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.,
 and The Guardian&#8217;s Heidi Moore to discuss how the &#8220;center&#8221;
 of the debate over the next budget could be found so much closer
 to Paul Ryan&#8217;s plan than that put forward by the Congressional
 Progressive Caucus. As Nadler pointed out during the conversation,
 the progressive proposal was unlikely to gain any traction,
 but many progressives and supporters of the president remained
 hopeful that any compromise budget would not include major cuts
 to the social safety net.

<p>Those hopes were crushed Friday when reports from the White House
 confirmed that the budget President Obama planned to unveil
 next week would include reductions in Social Security, Medicare
 despite widespread popular opposition. These cuts were not enough
 to satisfy House Majority Leader John Boehner, who insisted
 that the president&#8217;s cuts were not deep enough and his
 proposed tax increases were too onerous.

<p>Now that it is crystal clear that any compromise between Republican
 House members and the president will result in a deeply conservative
 policy, go back and watch Hayes and his guests break down how
 it all happened, tune in Sunday for the last episode of Up w/
 Chris Hayes, and come back on April 13 for Up w Steve Kornacki.
