<h>People don&#8217;t understand the fiscal cliff

<p>We&#8217;ve been hearing endlessly about the fiscal cliff. And
 yet, when it comes to the impact of going over that cliff, many
 people appear to have it exactly backwards.

<p>Forty-seven percent of respondents to an online poll conducted
 by Survey Monkey on behalf of Business Insider wrongly said
 that going over the cliff would mean the deficit gets larger.
 Just 12.6 percent accurately said it would mean the deficit
 shrinks. And 11.9% said it would stay the same.

<p>As Business Insider notes, Survey Monkey has a good track record
 and was more accurate during the election than many phone-based
 pollsters.

<p>If Congress doesn&#8217;t come to a deal to raise taxes and cut
 spending before it leaves, we&#8217;ll go over the cliff on
 Jan 1st—though it&#8217;s really more of a slope. That means
 a combination of spending cuts and tax hikes worth abut $607
 billion will go into effect, thanks to an agreement made last
 year between Congress and the Obama administration, which prioritized
 reducing the deficit at all costs.

<p>The problem is that raising taxes and cutting spending, especially
 doing so suddenly, will depress already-weak economic growth,
 leading to higher unemployment and perhaps even another recession.
 The Congressional Budget Office found it&#8217;ll cause the
 economy to contract by about 0.5% in 2013, though some economists
 say that estimate is too low.

<p>And that highlights why the poll result is troubling.  People
 know that going over the cliff means bad things. And thanks
 to Washington&#8217;s obsession with cutting the deficit, rather
 than growing the economy and fighting unemployment, the bad
 thing people constantly hear about is the deficit. So they assume
 that going over the cliff must mean that the deficit gets bigger.

<p>In fact, most economists say what we need right now is spending
 and tax cuts to stimulate the economy in the short term, temporarily
 widening the deficit. Then, once solid economic growth has been
 restored, we can go about drawing up a long-term plan to get
 the deficit under control.

<p>But it&#8217;s just about impossible to have a fruitful debate
 on this while people don&#8217;t even understand the basics.
