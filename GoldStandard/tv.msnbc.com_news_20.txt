<h>Photo Finish: Cycle Guilty Pleasure Jams

<p>What are your guilty pleasure jams? Our Cyclists reveal theirs
 in today&#8217;s post. (

<p> This past week I have been racking my brain trying to figure
 out an interesting, clever topic to write about. But every time
 I started to type something of the more serious nature out of
 no where I hear rhythmic, pulsing, electronic beats, my head
 starts to bob and all the sudden I have the urge to shout &#8220;Oppa
 gangnam style&#8220;!  Yes, yes, i know, this video has already
 gone viral 10 times over (though I know a certain pop-culture
 &#8220;maven&#8221; who was only recently acquainted with this
 K-pop sensation..about 2 months too late, but better late than
 never right?) but I shamelessly replay this song when I need
 a jolt in my day that caffeine can no longer provide. Maybe my
 playlist also includes the likes of Carly Rae Jespsen, Britney
 Spears, Lady Gaga and Beyonce (one who I will most certainly
 never be ashamed of looping and replaying!) but I would like
 to challenge anyone who says they do not have a guilty pleasure
 pop song in their playlists. Especially those &#8220;pseudo-hipster-i-only-play-obscure-indie-bands-no-one-has-heard-of&#8221;
 types too. That being said, I took this to the team ofThe
 Cycle and collectively we came up with this quick playlist
 of songs we should be tired of hearing&#8230;but you know what?
 We aren&#8217;t! We do love a good jam that we can take a break
 and dance to.  This is only Part I of Cycle Guilty Pleasure
 Jams, more to come later. But, what are some of your guilty
 pleasure pop songs that are looping in your head? Tweet us your
 suggestions to make the next playlist @thecyclemsnbc.)
