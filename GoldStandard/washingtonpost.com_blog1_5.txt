<h>About Ask The Post

<p>Welcome to Ask The Post.

<p>We hope this blog will build on the ongoing conversations between
 the Post newsroom and readers.

<p>Each day, we&rsquo;ll take questions from readers about our Web
 site and news coverage. To participate, you only need to leave
 a comment or tweet a question using the hash tag #askthepost.
 Use the &ldquo;Recommend&rdquo; link to vote up your favorite
 questions (make sure you&rsquo;re signed in to washingtonpost.com
 first). We will aim to respond to the most recommended questions
 throughout the week.

<p>As we have occasionally done with reader chats, we&rsquo;ll now
 feature, each week, a Post journalist, who will also respond
 to reader questions about his or her work and related journalism
 issues.

<p>Have a gripe about or a favorite feature from the front page
 of today&rsquo;s print edition of the newspaper? You are invited
 to write brief critique of the page in the comments section.
 Remember, this is a place for a succinct critique of the front
 page. There are other venues for your opinions and letters,
 as well as a way to reach the ombudsman.

<p>We&rsquo;ll hold comments on Ask The Post to the same standard
 as other comments on our site. While we are looking for constructive
 feedback from our readers, we&rsquo;ll remove comments that
 attack fellow commentators or otherwise violate our discussions
 policy.

<p>Ask The Post also will keep you updated on new Web site features,
 upgrades to existing features and other technical improvements.
 We appreciate your feedback on these issues as well, but if
 you&rsquo;re having a technical issue, please report it using
 this form.

<p>We look forward to your feedback.
