<h>May Day in Bangladesh

<p>Chris Hayes takes us through the history of May Day, the original
 Labor Day, as workers marched for better wages and working conditions
 all across the globe-- including workers in Bangladesh, which
 is still reeling from the collapse of a building that housed
 at least five garment factories.  

<p>Wednesday was May 1st, &#8220;May Day&#8221;—the original Labor
 Day, then &#8220;International Worker&#8217;s Day.&#8221; It&#8217;s
 really the left&#8217;s only global holiday. Pictures show
 people around the world, taking to the streets and protesting. They
 are demanding higher wages, better benefits and safer working
 conditions. Something, many of us in this country, take for
 granted, and the great irony of May 1st is that it is recognized
 all around the world, but its birthplace is here at home.

<p>May Day started in Chicago. In 1886, workers peacefully came
 together, striking for an eight-hour work day. That rally turned
 deadly after a bomb was thrown at police—protesters and police
 alike lost their lives. You learn about the Haymarket Affair
 in school, but the story, essentially, has been lost to history. We
 forget about all the labor tragedies and triumphs along the
 way.

<p>On a day like May Day, we think about the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist
 Factory fire, which killed 146 garment workers in New York City.
 We think about all the moments in American history when people
 have struggled for basic autonomy—dignity, solidarity, and
 protection for themselves in the places where they work. Sometimes
 we think that all that stuff that happened in the 19th and 20th
 centuries: labor mobilization, fighting for better conditions—that&#8217;s
 is just some story. A fairytale from the past. But this battle
 is not in the past. It is very much in the present.

<p>Now take a look at Bangladesh—a country of 150 million people.
 And last week, the country suffered the single most lethal incident
 in the history of the garment industry.

<p>Rana Plaza was an eight-story building made out of concrete and
 glass, located in the outskirts of the capital city of Dhaka. It
 was built on a swamp, without the proper permits. And according
 to the country&#8217;s chief engineer, three of its stories
 were added illegally. Rana Plaza housed a number of businesses—including
 at least five garment factories that supplied Western clothing
 retailers. Last Wednesday, it collapsed. Over four hundred
 people have died, and that number is sure to rise, as the search
 for survivors has now turned into a mission to recover the dead. When
 I first read about this tragedy, I thought to myself: this is
 horrific.  But I also thought that this was one of those stories
 you read about, you feel awful, and you keep going about your
 day.

<p>It&#8217;s tempting to think that this is just the way the world
 is. That this kind of tragedy happens in that kind of country.
 The people of Bangladesh disagree. In the wake of this horrific
 event, there has been a society-wide mobilization. Not unlike
 what happened in India after a young woman was gang raped on
 a bus. Not unlike what happened here in this country, in the
 wake of Newtown, Conn., when a long-festering social problem
 announced itself in a way that shook the nation&#8217;s conscience.
 In the meantime, the horrific details surrounding Rana Plaza&#8217;s
 collapse keep trickling out.

<p> The New York Times reports on what went on the day before the
 building collapsed:

<p>&#8220;Workers on the third floor were stitching clothing when
 they were startled by a noise that sounded like an explosion.
 Cracks had appeared in the building.&#8221;

<p>An engineer came to assess the building. He examined three support
 pillars and concluded the building needed to be closed immediately.

<p>It wasn&#8217;t.

<p>Workers at Rana Plaza earned as little as $40 a month. They
 had no union. They didn&#8217;t even have the power to say,
 I cannot go to work today because I don&#8217;t feel safe. That
 lack of power is what killed them. The man who had all the
 power at Rana Plaza was the building&#8217;s owner, a man named
 Sohel Rana.The New York Times describes him &#8220;as untouchable
 as a mafia don.&#8221;

<p>Mr. Rana was reportedly involved in illegal drugs and guns. He
 also happened to be the local leader of the ruling political
 party&#8217;s youth wing. When it became clear he was responsible
 for the conditions at Rana Plaza, Mr. Rana tried to sneak out
 of the country. He was nabbed by the police, and is now going
 to be brought to trial. If these details outrage you, you are
 not alone.

<p>Today, thousands of Bangladeshis took to the streets in the capital
 city of Dhaka demanding better safety standards for their neighbors,
 their brothers, their sisters, for themselves. Because Bangladesh
 right now as a society is saying what other societies has said
 at other moments: Enough. This cannot stand. It is a stark
 reminder on this day, when we think about what it means for
 working people to band together and assert their power, it literally
 is a matter of life and death,.

<p>All of us have some type of understanding that the clothes we
 wear on our backs were made somewhere. They might have been
 made in one of the factories inside Rana Plaza. The future
 we should be heading towards isn&#8217;t a future in which our
 clothes aren&#8217;t made by people in Bangladesh—or other
 parts of the globe. The future is a future in which our clothes
 are made by people in Bangladesh—but those people have the
 right to form a union. They have the right to earn a living
 in an environment with the proper building permits. They have
 the right to go to work every day, earn a fair, livable wage,
 and come home every night—safe, to the people they love. It&#8217;s
 the most basic demand, but it doesn&#8217;t just happen by magic.
 It happens through struggle.

<p>Happy May Day.
