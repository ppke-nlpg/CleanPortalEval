<h>The problem of the color line

<p>Up host Chris Hayes talks about race, racism, and politics in
 his "Story of the Week."

<p>Last week, during a brief tangent in our discussion of Medicare
 that got at the nature of the Republican base, I was defending
 the GOP base against generalizations that they are, as a blanket
 matter, racists, misogynistic and homophobic and then concluded
 with this statement:

<p>&#8220;It is undeniably the case that racist Americans are almost
 entirely in one political coalition and not the other.&#8221;

<p>The problem with that statement is that it&#8217;s not true.
 I was just wrong about what the data say about the way explicit,
 avowed racists are distributed between the two parties. Economist
 Alex Tabarrok looked at some data from 2002 that show roughly
 equal percentages of white Democrats and white Republicans (around
 10%) favor laws against interracial marriage and about 15% of
 white members of both parties agree strongly with the statement
 &#8220;blacks shouldn&#8217;t be pushy.&#8221;

<p>He points to overwhelming majorities of both Democrats and Republicans
 who say they would vote for a black president and concludes:
 &#8220;It is undeniable that some Americans are racist but racists
 split about evenly across the parties. No party has a monopoly
 on racists.&#8221;

<p>Political scientist John Sides responded to Tabbarok to flesh
 out the picture a bit. Using data from the  2008 National Election
 Study he shows that the people who express explicitly racist
 views—such as that black people are lazy, or that black people
 are unintelligent—are more likely to be Republicans than Democrats.
 &#8220;Identification with the Democratic Party tends to decline,
 and identification with the Republican party tends to increase,
 as attitudes toward blacks become less favorable.&#8221;

<p>And when you look at General Social Survey data through the prism
 of ideology, this tendency is even clearer. Razib Khan writing
 for Discover Magazine points out that twice as many white conservatives
 as white liberals would &#8220;strongly oppose&#8221; a close
 relative marrying a black person. The good news is that the
 numbers in both cases are low, only 20% of white conservatives
 and 10% of white liberals.

<p>So: I was wrong when I said that &#8220;It is undeniably the
 case that racist Americans are almost entirely in one political
 coalition and not the other.&#8221; That is simply not borne
 out by the data. It was a moment, frankly, when my own biases
 led me to say something that wasn&#8217;t true. My bad for saying
 it and thank you internet for correcting me. But my deeper mistake
 was focusing on racists as a countable group of individuals,
 as people with an essential core nature that can be analyzed
 and charted. Rather than focusing on how race reverberates through
 the two different political coalitions and the vast racial disparites
 in the effects of the policies favored by each of those coalitions. This
 is a seductive error that the great Jay Smooth has warned us
 about, in his now classic how-to video about how to talk about
 race and racism.

<p>Remember the difference between the what they did conversation
 and the what they are conversation&#8230; The what they did
 conversation focuses strictly on the person&#8217;s words and
 actions and explaining why what they did and what they said
 is unacceptable&#8230; the what they are conversation on the
 other hand takes things one step further and uses what they
 did and what they said to draw conclusions about what kind of
 person they are. I don&#8217;t care what he is but I need to
 hold him accountable for what he did, and that&#8217;s how we
 need to approach these conversations about race.

<p>So instead of focusing on what conservatives are, we should keep
 the conversation focused on what they are doing, or, what they
 are calling for, and in this realm there are some very obvious
 racial asymmetries. The first and most obvious one is an issue
 we&#8217;ve been covering here on Up and on the network, the
 Republican push in many states to impose new restrictions on
 voting—whether through voter ID laws, or curtailiment of early
 voting—that will disproportionately disenfranchise people
 of color.

<p>One Ohio county chairman told the Columbus Dispatch he opposed
 additional voting hours because, &#8220;we shouldn&#8217;t contort
 the voting process to accommodate the urban—read, African-American—voter-turnout
 machine.&#8221; But the reality is, you don&#8217;t have to
 have a single individual white racist in the entire party to
 pursue this strategy. And this is the core truth about American
 politics—we have a multi-racial society with two political
 coalitions. One of those coalitions, the Democrats, contains
 almost all of the African Americans, a majority of Latinos,
 and Asians and a minority of white people. The obvious racial
 disparity you see at the political rallies is also reflected
 in the institutional makeup of the parties.

<p>This is the racial breakdown of the US, according to the 2010
 census:

<p>And this is the racial breakdown for delegates to the RNC in
 2008:

<p>It is therefore not too surprising that in Tuesday&#8217;s NBC/Wall
 Street Journal poll Romney managed to get zero percent support
 from black voters. And keep in mind this is a country that is
 only growing less white. This is what America&#8217;s racial
 composition will look like in 2050, according to the Census
 Bureau: Just 50% white.

<p>Into a nation already reeling from a total crisis of authority,
 a cascade of institutional failure, and a stalking, corrosive
 anxiety about decline, the multi-racial political party nominated
 and then managed to get elected the first black man to run the
 country in the nation&#8217;s history.

<p>And one of the chief paradoxes of his time in office is that
 despite the fact that the economic misery produced by the crisis
 and recession has fallen disproportionately on people of color,
 they, according to Pew, are far more optimistic about the future
 than white people are. Barack Obama was elected partly on an
 implicit promise, or at least a promise thrust upon him, to
 suture the still gaping wounds of slavery, white-supremacist
 terrorism, rape, lynching, discrimination, and humiliation that
 have marked our body politic from its birth.

<p>Today, it is a wound that if no longer festering quite so openly
 is scarred over in such away that it cannot be scrubbed away
 or excised or even covered. It is part of who we are. At the
 turn of the 20th century, W.E.B. Dubois predicted, rightly,
 that the &#8220;problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem
 of the color-line.&#8221; Twelve years into the 21st century,
 on the eve of the nominating convention for the party that destroyed
 slavery and enshrined the right to vote and due process into
 the constitution, in the midst of the hard-fought reelection
 battle of the first black president, that line seems as un-erasable
 as ever from our politics.
