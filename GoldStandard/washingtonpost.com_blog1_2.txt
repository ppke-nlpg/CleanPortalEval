<h>Games and puzzles offerings expand for Washington Post readers

<p> By  Washington Post Editors

<p>We&rsquo;re pleased to announce that we&rsquo;re expanding our
 entertainment offerings with the launch of WP Games. This new
 section of our Web site, at games.washingtonpost.com, will offer
 dozens of interactive games, puzzles and quizzes. Best of all?
 Playing won&rsquo;t cost you a dime.

<p>Our roster of offerings includes arcade games, word games, card
 games and strategy puzzles. Like letters? Race the clock to
 form words with Spellbound. Got an eye for detail? Match tiles
 in Mahjongg or hunt through a Word Search. The visually inclined
 can try a Jigsaw, while card fans can play Spider Solitaire
 and Pool. 

<p>And the favorites you&rsquo;ve played on washingtonpost.com for
 years are still here: Crickler, Sudoku and our three popular
 puzzles &mdash; the Daily Crossword from Bob Klahn and CrosSynergy;
 the Sunday Crossword by Merl Reagle; and the Post Puzzler from
 Peter Gordon and Fireball Crosswords.

<p>Our new interactive offerings are the work of online games developer
 Arkadium. They&rsquo;re all Flash-based, so you&rsquo;ll need
 to be sure you&rsquo;ve installed and updated your Adobe Flash
 Player before you get started. If you need assistance along
 the way, check out our Help page or FAQs.

<p>Each game is free. Many can be printed to take on the road with
 you. And we&rsquo;re looking forward to making them accessible
 to mobile devices in the future.

<p>We hope you&rsquo;ll have fun exploring this new section. Ready
 to play? Game on.
