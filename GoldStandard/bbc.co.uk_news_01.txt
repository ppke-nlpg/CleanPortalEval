<h>One couple's mission to find a better work/life balance
 
<p>Popular DIY bloggers discuss balancing life with working from 
home (Produced by the BBC's David Botti)

<p>In the first of a new series of weekly articles looking at the
 successes and challenges of small companies around the world,
 the BBC&#039;s Kate Dailey visits Richmond, Virginia, to explore
 how one married couple who run their own business from home
 manage to create a work-life balance.

<p>John and Sherry Petersik run a successful blog about their life
 at home. But when your business is built around writing about
 your life, how do you balance the two? 

<p>The set-up seems like a dream - work with your spouse to build
 your perfect kitchen, blog about it, and make enough money from
 doing so that both of you can stay at home and raise your child.
 

<p>But it&#039;s not nearly that simple.

<p>That&#039;s what John and Sherry Petersik, founders of the blog
 Young House Love, have discovered in the five years their blog
 has turned from a project for friends and family to an internet
 phenomenon. 

<p>The Petersiks now work full-time at the blog, which offers do-it-yourself
 projects, home renovation tips, and profiles of reader redesign.
 They post seven times a week and garner more than five million
 page views a month. 

<p>'Two-person newspaper'

<p>While the success of the blog has allowed them both to work from
 home and raise their two-year-old daughter, Clara, it&#039;s
 presented its own challenges. 

<p>In 2012, the Petersiks published a book of home-improvement projects

<p>"It&#039;s like a two-person newspaper, you&#039;re churning
 out stories every day," says Sherry. "It&#039;s not like you
 paint something and then it&#039;s on the blog. You paint it
 and then you have to wait for good lighting to photograph it.

<p>"And then you have to write something and then you&#039;re the
 editor and you have to proof it. And then you edit again and
 then you share it, and people have questions, so you&#039;re
 doing public relations."

<p>And when your job is based around your home life, it can be difficult
 to draw a hard line between public and private, between work
 and play. When they&#039;re enjoying time together as a family,
 says John, the pressure to share with their readers is ever-present.

<p>"There&#039;s a voice on the back of our head - should we be
 taking a picture of this?" he says. 

<p>"We&#039;re trying to develop a second voice to argue, &#039;Just
 enjoy this for what it is. You don&#039;t have to share with
 the rest of the world. They have enough of you already.&#039;"

<p>To that end, the Petersiks have made work-life balance a frequent,
 public pursuit. For the past three years, they have included
 some variation of this desire on the occasional lists of goals
 they post on their site.

<p>'Don't burn out'

<p>But cutting back comes at a price. 

<p>"A lot of people, even ourselves when we started, don&#039;t
 realise that when you want to turn a blog it into a job, it
 does become a business. You have to figure out where your income
 is going to come from, you have to manage those revenue streams,"
 says John. 

<h>Balancing act: Tips for the self-employed

<p>Breaking away from work is tricky no matter who you are, but
 for those who work from home can find it exceptionally difficult
 to carve out personal and professional time.

<p>Kristie Arslan, president of the National Association for the
 Self-Employed, offered some tips for at-home workers:

<l>Make a schedule: You have to create your schedule like a normal
 work day - work from 09:00-17:00, or whatever works for you,
 and stick to those hours.

<l>Close the door: When the workday ends, leave your working space
 - and close it off for the night. Whether it&#039;s an office
 or just a corner of the kitchen, don&#039;t use it for anything
 but work. 

<l>Stick to it: You have to maintain that schedule, because if you
 don&#039;t you fall victim to creep.

<l>Get out: If it&#039;s impossible to feel relaxed at home, seek
 external office space. Co-working spaces provide both a neutral
 work environment and "the water cooler experience". 

<p>The couple is responsible for quarterly business taxes. They
 must keep up their health insurance payments, pay for server
 space, hire an accountant, and put money away for their retirement.

<p>Though the Petersiks in the past have made revenue through paid
 writing jobs and private design consulting, the majority of
 their income now comes from advertising on the site - either
 through automatically generated Google ads, or through direct
 site sponsors, which often include design and home supply companies
 such as the Tile Shop. The sponsors are individually managed
 by the couple themselves, 

<p>In order to generate that ad revenue, they need to ensure a steady
 flow of traffic - so cutting back requires some careful consideration.
 

<p>"We have to figure it out while still guarding the business,
 because this puts food on the table and pays for our daughter&#039;s
 roof over her head," Sherry says. 

<p>"We can&#039;t be stupid about it, but we need to make choices
 that make this sustainable for us in the long haul so we don&#039;t
 burn out."

<p>Struggling to find a work-life balance is a problem that plagues
 many workers, especially those who are self-employed. In the
 US, that includes 80% of small businesses, says the National
 Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) - and that same segment
 is growing faster than any other in the US economy.

<p>As the site - and their visibility - has grown, the Petersiks
 have been able to supplement their revenue through projects
 like a best-selling book and a lighting line. They&#039;re also
 determined to maintain their current traffic targets while writing
 one less post a week. 

<p>'Goals intertwined'

<p>But, Matthew Kelly, the head of Floyd Consulting, reminds the
 couple that work-life balance may be elusive for a reason. 

<p>The Petersiks say a happy marriage is key to their successful
 business

<p>"The term itself is fatally flawed," he says. "Work and life
 are too intertwined."

<p>Kelly, the author of Off Balance: Getting Beyond the Work-Life
 Balance Myth to Personal and Professional Satisfaction, says
 that more important than being balanced is being "satisfied"
 both professionally and personally. "The idea that I&#039;m
 going to spend as much time with my professional stuff as with
 my personal stuff just doesn&#039;t work," he says. 

<p>Instead, he recommends to his clients that they establish what
 is important to them in their personal lives and then carve
 out non-negotiable time to get that done, even if it means working
 odd hours.

<p>That&#039;s a skill that the Petersiks already practise. "As
 much as we talk about working nights and weekends, a lot of
 that is because we&#039;re stay-at-home parents and we don&#039;t
 take that lightly," Sherry says. "When she&#039;s awake and
 it is a nice day, we will take her to the park, and then we&#039;ll
 work when she&#039;s asleep." 

<p>After all, making time for family and home life is essential
 to the couple&#039;s success. 

<p>"Our life goals sort of piggyback off of our work goals because
 they are so intertwined," John says. 

<p>"We still need to experience life, and have a happy marriage
 and happy family, to make the business work."
