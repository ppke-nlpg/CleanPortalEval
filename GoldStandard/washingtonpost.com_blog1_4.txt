<h>Introducing an all-new version of our flagship iPad app

<p>Dear readers,

<p>We’re excited to roll out to you an all-new version of our
 flagship iPad app, one that provides a top-of-the-line news
 app experience for our journalism.

<p>We&#8217;ve built out the best of everything on our Web site
 and included all of the journalism in our printed paper. You
 can now have the complete digital and print Washington Post
 wherever you go. With a richly designed reading experience,
 we’re now bringing you a replica of the printed newspaper,
 along with a 14-day archive, over 40 comic strips, all Post
 blogs and real-time social. The app gives you video, photo galleries,
 new search functionality and offline reading &#8212; a bonus
 for travelers and commuters without a live Internet connection.

<p>Another feature we’re proud of is The Forum, a tool that makes
 it easy for iPad users to identify, organize and customize conversations
 on Twitter. In addition to our already popular political Forum, we&#8217;ve added
 a D.C. area sports Forum featuring tweets from athletes, sports
 figures and local media.

<p>The Washington Post app for iPad is available as a complimentary
 subscription to all users until the app becomes part of The
 Post’s new digital subscription model, launching in the summer
 of 2013.

<p>You can download it here.

<p>Thank you for reading The Post in print and online. We look forward 
to delivering it to you on the iPad.

<p>Marty Baron is Executive Editor of The Washington Post.
