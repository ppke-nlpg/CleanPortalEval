<h>Chatham House report: Famine risks are badly managed

<p>Famine early warning systems have a good track record of predicting
 food shortages but are poor at triggering early action, a report
 has concluded.

<p>The study said the opportunity for early action was being missed
 by governments and humanitarian agencies.

<p>It said the "disconnect" was starkly apparent in Somalia where
 no action was taken despite 11 months of warnings.

<p>Up to two million people are estimated to have died in drought-related
 emergencies since 1970. 

<p>The report by UK think-tank Chatham House, Managing Famine Risk:
 Linking Early Warning to Early Action, looked at the issue of
 drought-related emergencies on a global scale but focused on
 the Horn of Africa and the Sahel regions.

<p>"The regions are quite unique in a way because you have these
 droughts, where there are normally successive failed rains;
 then you have a process whereby you have subsequent harvest
 failures then people adopt coping strategies," explained report
 author Rob Bailey.

<p>"They start selling off assets, running down food reserves, taking
 on credit - they get themselves into an increasingly desperate
 situation."

<p>Mr Bailey, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said that
 after a period of time the coping strategies became exhausted,
 triggering a famine. 

<p>"But the whole process can take 11 months from start to finish,
 and that is why there is an opportunity to intervene early,"
 he told BBC News. 

<p>"Yet despite this very significant opportunity and despite analysis
 showing that when you do intervene early it costs less and you
 save more lives, it does not happen."

<h>Gambling with lives

<p>The main reason, he observed, why there was a delay, was a result
 of perceived political risk by governments. 

<p>"Ultimately, early action requires government action," he added.

<p>"It requires donor governments - like the UK and US - to write
 a cheque early on before the crisis is at its worse phase, and
 that is a big ask for governments to do because governments
 are primarily concerned with managing the political risks to
 themselves.

<p>Unstable political systems can complicate aid efforts to help
 starving people during famines

<p>"They see political risks in funding these sorts of things because
 budgets are tight and public support for aid spending is less
 than it used to be, so it is seen as a particularly risky endeavour
 at the moment."

<p>If the early action by donor governments prevented the crisis,
 that could also cause problems as well because it could be argued
 that there was not a crisis waiting to happen in the first place.
 

<p>Mr Bailey cited the 2011 famine in Somalia as an example where
 the issue of political risk shaped the global response to the
 humanitarian emergency.

<p>"That was not a result of early warning information - it was
 probably the single most documented and monitored evolution
 of famine in history," he explained.

<p>"But still no early action happened and probably the main reason
 for that is because the areas of Somalia that were at most risk
 where under control of a Jihadist militia, which the US and
 other western donor nations categorise as a terrorist organisation."

<p>He added that there was concern among donor nations that carrying
 out humanitarian missions in those areas could strengthen the
 position of the militia, especially if aid ended up in the hands
 of the group.

<h>Counting the cost

<p>Early warning systems were first introduced in the Sahel and
 Horn of Africa regions in the early 1980s when it was first
 realised that it was possible to track the "chronology of famine".

<p>"Since then, things have got a lot more sophisticated so now
 there are early warning systems that use satellite to estimate
 harvests more effectively, how much pasture is available. We
 have more much more sophisticated weather forecasting models."
 Mr Bailey said.

<p>"They also use a lot more household-gathered data, where infants
 are weighed and malnutrition is quantified. Also, it is monitored
 whether certain coping strategies, that are recognised as pre-famine
 indicators, are becoming established."

<p>He explained that a full-blown emergency response was very expensive,
 so there was a strong financial argument to act sooner rather
 than later.

<p>It is estimated that earlier intervention saves aid budgets about
 $1,000 per person affected by famine

<p>"When you are at the situation where malnutrition rates are very
 high and people are dying then you need to be moving very large
 amounts of food, medicines and healthcare products through pipelines
 to areas where access is often very poor.

<p>"Humanitarian agencies have often said that early intervention
 is cheaper. There was a study carried out recently that looked
 at the potential savings of acting sooner rather than later.

<p>"This involved a range of initiatives, such as pre-positioning
 of food and medicine supplies so agencies are able to source
 them earlier, perhaps when prices were lower."

<p>A recent study looked at intervention costs in Kenya and southern
 Ethiopia over two decades. It found that, on average, early
 intervention resulted in a saving of US$1,000 per person.

<p>"This is serious money when multiplied by the number of people
 affected in these situations," Mr Bailey calculated. An estimated
 18 million people were affected during the Sahel crisis last
 year, he added.

<p>Drought-related emergencies, particularly in the Horn of Africa
 and Sahel regions, were unlikely to go away in the future, projected
 scenarios showed.

<p>"I think there is a very strong case to be made that the agricultural
 trends, the demographic trends and the climatic trends are pointing
 towards a rapidly deteriorating risk outlook," Mr Bailey said.

<p>"The key message is that early warning systems give us a real
 opportunity to manage that risk really effectively.

<p>"It is very rare that you can have a risk that can be so well
 understood and predicted, and give us such an opportunity to
 intervene and mitigate it."
