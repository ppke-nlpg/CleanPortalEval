<h>Hax-Philes: Discuss advice in our new Hax forum!

<p>Calling all Hax-Philes! You can now chat about your favorite
 Carolyn Hax content &#8212; from the letters that shocked you
 the most to the poignant advice that helped you &#8212; in our
 new Carolyn Hax forum.

<p>We recently rolled out forums for sports, politics and other
 topics on washingtonpost.com. For Hax fans, we&#8217;ve set
 up a forum that will allow you to discuss columns and weekly
 chats, seek advice from other readers and even go off topic,
 if that&#8217;s your thing. The forum will also be the new home
 for Hax-Philes, where Carolyn lets readers weigh in on the qualms
 of advice-seeking letter writers.

<p>Creating new forum topics is easy &#8211;  click the New Topic
 button, fill in the fields that appear and click Post.
