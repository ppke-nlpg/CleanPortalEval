<h>Way forward in Syria divides lawmakers

<p>In light of this week’s revelation that Syrian President Bashar
 al-Assad might have used chemical weapons against rebels fighting
 to unseat him, leaders from both sides of the aisle are becoming
 more vocal about what role the United States should play in
 the country. Having described such an attack as a &#8220;red
 line&#8221; that would solicit a &#8221;prudent&#8221; response
 from the U.S., some are wondering how President Obama plans
 to respond to the alleged attacks.

<p>David Rhode, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and Reuters columnist,
 suggested that the U.S. take a more passive route, helping with
 economic aid and trading among other non-lethal aid on Weekends
 with Alex Witt Sunday.

<p>&#8220;Our people are terrified of mistakenly training one Jihadist,
 because they know they&#8217;ll be pounced on in Washington
 in our partisan atmosphere. So our division at home is sort
 of leading us to be too cautious and we really have no power
 abroad because we&#8217;re so divided at home,&#8221; Rhode
 said, suggesting that the U.S. should make it easier to strengthen
 opposition on the ground.

<p>The White House explained this week that evidence of Syria&#8217;s
 chemical use is preliminary and that the government would be
 gathering more intelligence on the matter.

<p>Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona has called for a no-fly
 zone in order to offset Syria&#8217;s air power and a plan for
 securing Syria&#8217;s stockpiles of weapons. Democrats such
 as Senator Clair McCaskill of Missouri have called for less
 military aid and more humanitarian assistance to civilians.
