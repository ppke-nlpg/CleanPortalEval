<h>Shanghai closes poultry markets over bird flu

<p>Chinese officials in the city of Shanghai have ordered the temporary
 closure of its poultry markets due to the H7N9 bird flu outbreak.

<p>A spokesman for the city authorities said the decision was taken on
 grounds of public safety. 

<p>The city has already begun a mass slaughter of poultry after the
 virus was discovered in pigeons at a market.

<p>Six people have died in this latest outbreak. The H7N9 virus is a
 form of avian flu not seen before in humans.

<p>China has officially confirmed 14 cases and six deaths due to H7N9
 infection as of Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said
 in a statement. 

<p>The cases are reportedly from eastern China, including in Shanghai
 and Zhejiang province.

<p>WHO says there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission.

<p>"We have 14 cases in a large geographical area, we have no sign of
 any epidemiological linkage between the confirmed cases and we have
 no sign of sustained human-to-human transmission," WHO spokesman
 Gregory Hartl said in Geneva.

<p>The latest fatality was a farmer, 64, who died in Zhejiang province,
 state-run media say.

<p>Four of the bird flu fatalities and six of the 14 cases have been
 recorded in Shanghai. 

<p>The city is also monitoring another person who was in close contact
 with one of those who died after showing flu-like symptoms. 

<p>Shanghai health official, Wu Fan, was quoted by Agence-France Presse
 news agency as saying that the person tested negative for H7N9.

<p>"There is no possibility of spreading the infection overseas," Wu Fan
 also told a press conference. 

<p>Officials ordered the slaughter of at least 20,000 birds starting
 late on Thursday after the virus was detected in pigeons sold in
 Huhuai market.

<p>The market was sealed and police stood watch as workers disinfected
 the areas, reports say.

<p>Xu Wei, a spokesman for the Shanghai government, said trading of
 live poultry will be suspended on Saturday.
