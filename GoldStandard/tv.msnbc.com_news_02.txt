<h>Sandra Fluke: 'Legitimate rape' - Romney, Ryan's records offer warning

<p>Why are we surprised by Rep. Todd Akin’s appalling statement
 distinguishing which rapes are &#8220;legitimate&#8221;? Why
 are we surprised that Akin, the Republican nominee for the U.S.
 Senate from Missouri, thinks that victims of “legitimate rape”
 don’t get pregnant because “the female body has ways to
 try to shut that whole thing down?” And why are we surprised
 that he wants to outlaw abortion even in the case of rape?

<p>Disgusted? Of course. But surprised? We already had clear evidence
 of what Akin believes from his record. Just last year, he joined
 Paul Ryan and more than 200 other House Republicans in co-sponsoring
 legislation that would have narrowed which types of rape victims
 could benefit from financial assistance to access abortion services.
 The bill would have cut off victims who were drugged or threatened,
 some victims of incest, and victims of statutory rape—victims
 who, it appears, don&#8217;t fall into Akin&#8217;s definition
 of &#8220;legitimate&#8221; rape victims. As for the belief
 that women don’t need access to abortion when “legitimately
 raped” because their bodies will prevent a pregnancy, that&#8217;s
 not just some feverish product of Akin&#8217;s mind—it&#8217;s
 a widely held belief in radical anti-choice circles across the
 country.

<p>What’s more surprising is that Akin, along with Mitt Romney
 and Ryan, think they can run away from their record and fool
 the women of this country by offering vague apologies and calculated
 statements in the wake of a controversy like this. Whether a
 woman has the ability to make her own health care choices—including
 in the case of rape—is not something that our elected officials
 should be changing their positions on to suit the political
 climate. These are fundamental ethical questions that no person
 of conscience changes position on lightly. Either you firmly
 believe in protecting women or you don’t.

<p>Akin at first tried to defuse the controversy by saying he merely
 “misspoke.” And Romney and Ryan are working overtime to
 distance themselves from Akin’s remarks. But the records tell
 a different story: All three have previously gone on record
 as supporting outlawing all abortions, including in the case
 of rape, and have taken actions to match.

<l>As Massachusetts governor, Romney vetoed a bill to guarantee
 victims of rape access to emergency contraception in hospital
 emergency rooms.

<l>Romney has repeatedly endorsed the 2004 and 2008 Republican Party
 platforms, and has specifically backed the platform&#8217;s
 Human Life Amendment to ban abortion nationwide, which has no
 exceptions for rape and incest. A similar measure is set to
 be included in the 2012 platform, to be adopted next week.

<l>Romney has said that he now has the same positions that he had
 when he previously ran for president, and said that he would
 be “delighted” to sign a bill to outlaw ALL abortions.

<l>In 2011, Ryan co-sponsored a bill that declared a fertilized
 egg that hasn&#8217;t even resulted in a pregnancy to be the
 equivalent of a living person, with all of the rights of federal
 law. That bill criminalized all abortion with no exceptions
 for rape.

<p>Of course, Romney and Ryan have muddied the waters by at times
 allowing exceptions to their anti-choice stance. But as a wise
 woman, Lilly Ledbetter, once warned me, we must always look
 to an elected official’s record, never simply to politically
 opportune statements. Actions always speak louder than words.

<p>Although we shouldn’t have been surprised by Akin’s awful
 statement, we must be forewarned that if elected, Romney and
 Ryan will continue their extreme and dangerous record on women’s
 health.

<p> Sandra Fluke graduated cum laude from Georgetown University
 Law Center and has served as president of Georgetown Law Students
 for Reproductive Justice. She has endorsed and campaigned for
 President Obama.
