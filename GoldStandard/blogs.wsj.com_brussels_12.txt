<h>Roma Turn Up at EU Summit

<p>A Roma woman with a child passes a logo of the European Commission
 in Brussels.

<p>Not literally. But fur is flying between France and the European
 Commission, which in the person of Justice Commissioner Viviane
 Reding this week strongly condemned the ongoing French campaign
 to deport Gypsies (also known as Roma).

<p>The Roma issue is creeping into today&#8217;s EU summit, which
 is supposed to be about foreign policy.

<p>French officials have lined up to denounce Mrs. Reding&#8217;s
 denunciation. They&#8217;ve directed their ire at her remark
 that forced removal on the basis of ethnicity &#8220;is a situation
 I would have thought Europe would not have to witness again
 after the Second World War.&#8221;

<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy&#8217;s office yesterday put
 out a brief statement deeming the comments &#8220;outrageous.&#8221;
 Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon stacked up a trio of adjectives:
 &#8220;implausible, unimaginable, scandalous.&#8221; Even German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel weighed in Wednesday night, calling
 the comparison &#8220;unsuitable.&#8221;

<p>Mr. Sarkozy has an ally in Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi,
 and the two appear determined to bring a discussion of Gypsies
 to the summit.

<p>Mrs. Reding backed off the World War II reference last night,
 but she nonetheless appears to have outmaneuvered France.

<p>No European commissioner &#8212; indeed, no European politician
 &#8212; plays the Nazi card lightly, and Mrs. Reding is among
 the most media-savvy people in Brussels. Her reference appeared
 carefully calibrated &#8212; it&#8217;s in her prepared remarks
 &#8212; and it served its purpose.

<p>France is left to sputter that its deportations aren&#8217;t
 as bad as the Nazis&#8217;, while Mrs. Reding&#8217;s point
 &#8212; that it&#8217;s plainly illegal to select deportees
 by race &#8212; is left largely unchallenged.

<p>And by making the remark two days before the summit, Mrs. Reding
 all but guarantees that Mr. Sarkozy himself will have to address
 it if he holds his customary press conference this afternoon.

<p>Stay tuned.
