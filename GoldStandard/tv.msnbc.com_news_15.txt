<h>Romney policy adviser: GOP activists will have &#8216;very little&#8217;
 purchase on a Romney presidency

<p>In talking about the base of the Republican party, Avik Roy,
 health care policy advisor to Mitt Romney, told the Up w/ Chris
 Hayes panelists that GOP activists have "very little" purchase
 on a Mitt Romney presidency. Former RNC Chairman Michael Steele
 joins to discuss.

<p>Updated | Thursday, August 30: Includes additional comments
 from Roy during the program clarifying his remark.

<p> A policy adviser to Republican presidential candidate Mitt
 Romney said Sunday that the Republican activists who write and
 adhere to the party’s platform, and who will gather in Tampa
 this week to formally nominate Romney for president, will have
 “very little” purchase on a Romney presidency if the former
 Massachusetts governor is elected.

<p>Avik Roy, a health care policy adviser to the Romney campaign,
 said the GOP platform — which includes provisions like a “human
 life amendment” to the Constitution that would ban abortions
 with no exceptions for rape, incest or to save the life of the
 mother — should not be considered a reflection of Romney’s
 personal views.

<p>“I think it is a statement of what activists in the party,
 the consensus among activists in the party believe should be
 the core of activist conservatism,” Roy said. “But that
 is different from what a candidate who is appealing to the center
 of the country is going to try to do.”

<p>Asked how much purchase those activists would have in the White
 House should Romney become president, Roy said, “very little.”

<p>Roy later clarified his remark, adding: &#8220;The base influences
 things for sure. So, they influence the terms of the debate,
 they influence the primaries, they influence who gets elected
 to congress, they influence who staffs an administration. But
 it’s also true that there is a need to win elections. There
 is a need to both move the debate in your direction, but also
 appeal to the people in the center, and that’s the tension.
 So, as activists your job is to move the debate in your direction.
 &#8230; The candidates reflect how that debate changes over
 time.&#8221;

<p>Former Republican chairman and MSNBC analyst Michael Steele criticized
 attempts by Romney to distance himself from aspects of the Republican
 Party platform, as well as the activists who drafted it.

<p>“I know a lot of folks in the base. I’m from the base, I
 know the base. They don’t want to hear their nominee, as they
 produce this platform, go, ‘Oh, that’s not my platform,’
 or the Republican Party chairman say, ‘Oh, that’s not his
 platform, that doesn’t mean anything to him,’” Steele
 said. “They don’t want to hear that.”
