<h>Paul Ryan, the new face of single-parent households?

<p>Paul Ryan suffered a horrible tragedy in his teenage years, when
 his father died of a heart attack. &#8220;It was just a big
 punch in the gut. I concluded I&#8217;ve either got to sink
 or swim in life,&#8221; the Wisconsin congressman and Republican
 vice presidential candidate told Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker.

<p>Ryan chose to swim, and that choice has become a recurring theme
 in his speeches. Recently, Ryan raised this theme when he spoke
 to a defense industry roundtable last week: &#8220;Only in
 America do you have young people like this who are inspired
 by the ideals of our country and who have this pathway. And
 in this case, a pathway out of poverty and into a life of self-discipline,
 of self-sufficiency, of pride.&#8221;

<p>Indeed, many single-parent homes, of which Ryan has become a
 prominent face, grapple with poverty. Ryan&#8217;s family did
 not face poverty, but Ryan and his family did wrestle with the
 financial and emotional hardships of losing a parent. And, as
 I can say from experience, they did not do it alone.

<p>Paul Ryan and I have something in common: we both lost our fathers
 at a young age. I had just turned 15 when my dad died from a
 heart attack; Ryan was 16. Betty Ryan Douglas had four kids
 to look after, including Paul, the youngest. As Up host Chris
 Hayes has noted, Ryan&#8217;s family relied on help from multiple
 support networks, including the successful Ryan Incorporated
 Central, founded in 1884 by Ryan&#8217;s great-grandfather.
 As a lawyer, Ryan&#8217;s father, Paul Ryan Sr., had been a
 high wage earner.

<p>Lizza documents the familial foundation Ryan maintains to this
 day &#8212; he lives in the same town where he was born, his
 aunt and uncle live across the street, his cousin is next door,
 his brother a block away. The Ryan clan has a considerable presence
 in Janesville, Wisconsin, one to which Ryan and his family could
 turn for support. The Ryan family also relied on assistance
 from the government, including Social Security, which paid out survivor&#8217;s
 benefitsafter Ryan&#8217;s father&#8217;s death. Social Security,
 Ryan said in 2005, &#8220;was there to help us when we needed
 the help.&#8221; Having experienced the same loss, I can say
 that that help is crucial.

<p>Losing a parent &#8212; or anyone close to you &#8212; can be
 incredibly traumatic and destabilizing. But the benefit of financial
 stability, which Ryan and I were both lucky enough to have,
 steadies the loosened ground upon which you find yourself standing
 in the wake of a parent&#8217;s death.

<p>Single-parent homes comprise 29.5 percent of all households
 in the United States, and Ryan would deal many of them a considerable
 blow with his proposed changes to Medicaid, the Supplemental
 Nutritional Assistance Program, taxes and Social Security. More
 than 31 percentof households headed by single women and more
 than 15 percent of households headed by single men are poor.
 These families rely on the social safety net.

<p>With Ryan&#8217;s proposed Path to Prosperity, states would
 receive one-third less of their current Medicaid funding by
 2022. The Congressional Budget Office concludes that states
 would either have to dramatically increase funding to keep pace
 with medical costs or slash eligibility, benefits, and/or provider
 payments.

<p>Ryan&#8217;s suggested changes to SNAP further undermine single-parent
 households, which are more likely to rely on SNAP than those
 with married parents. Ryan&#8217;s plan would cut 17 percentof
 the program&#8217;s budget, or $133.5 billion, over a decade.
 More than one-fifth of single-father households and nearly two-fifths
 of single-mother households depend on SNAP benefits.

<p>Ryan&#8217;s plan would also raise taxes on many of these single-parent
 households. Any household making $30,000 or less would see a
 slight increase in their tax burden, while the top earners would
 all see more tax cuts.

<p>
 Ryan has stated that he saved the payments from the Social
 Security survivor&#8217;s benefits program to help pay for his
 college tuition. Ryan, of course, could afford to save that
 money because of his family&#8217;s financial situation. I did
 the same. We both benefited from the social safety net, but
 we both chose how to make use of those benefits. For many people,
 these threatened programs are lifelines &#8212; they don&#8217;t
 have the luxury of choosing when and how to use them.

<p>Ryan and I are lucky. We both had loving families who were also
 fortunate enough to be financially stable. We both had fathers
 whom we knew and who played major roles in our lives. We both
 have strong mothers who held our families together. That same
 cannot be said for many of the children living in the more than
 10.5 million single-parent homes across the country.
