<h>Insight selling: How retailers sell to us by stealth

<p>Successful small firms are coming up with novel ways to connect 
with their customers, as the BBC's Jane O'Brien reports from Washington DC

<p>Jordan Mittelman is obsessed with cycling - a passion he&#039;s
 harnessed to launch an award-winning business in the heart of
 Washington DC.

<p>The US capital already has a large number of bike shops, and
 Mr Mittelman knew his High Street store, Bicycle Space, could
 only succeed by offering customers more than competitive prices
 and good service. 

<p>"People can find all the products we sell online, and are often
 so well-read and knowledgeable. They&#039;ve looked up every
 detail and come in knowing so much," he says.

<p>"To sell to those people you have to appeal to something greater
 - we&#039;re selling a lifestyle and an experience."

<p>Marketers call this insight selling.

<p>"It&#039;s learning about the consumer in order to offer the
 product in a new way that doesn&#039;t rely on hard sell," explains
 Patrick Spenner, managing director of CEB, a global business
 advisory company that has its headquarters in Washington DC.

<h>Key marketing trends for 2013

<p>As more companies take advantage of digital platforms and new
 ways of reaching consumers, marketers have predicted a number
 of trends that should be important for businesses this year:

<p>Insight selling - Offering lifestyle information about a product
 that is educational and informative instead of relying on hard
 sell. 

<p>Content marketing - Interactive or digital material that influences
 a consumer&#039;s choice during the research and decision making
 process.

<p>Thought leadership - Creating the perception that the company
 is innovative and an expert in its field.

<p>Digital analytics - Using the trail of information consumers
 create online to shape appealing content and inform insight
 selling.

<p>"For example, I&#039;m a cyclist. I cycle to work regularly and
 I struggle with finding safe paths. Wouldn&#039;t it be great
 if my local bike shop could use digital media to connect me
 with other consumers to share information about safer routes?

<p>"That&#039;s bringing &#039;insight&#039; to me about something
 broader than just my bike. And it creates an attachment to the
 business that enabled me to gain that insight."

<p>Mr Mittelman knows his customers enjoy the sense of community
 he and his staff help to create by organising bike rides and
 group maintenance workshops. 

<p>"People want to be a part of something and come to a place where
 they&#039;ll be taken care of. We&#039;re really a social gathering
 spot and an essential place to learn about bikes, use them and
 have a good time," he says.

<p>Changed strategy

<p>Garry Cha takes a similar approach to market his grocery chain,
 Yes! Organic Market, taking time to learn about his customers
 and understand their lifestyles.

<p>Most people who come through his doors are well-educated and
 health conscious. They want access to organic produce in a retail
 space that has the convenience of a corner shop. 

<p>Mr Cha opened his first store in 1989 and now operates seven
 across Washington DC with a $30m (Â£20m) turnover. But while
 his products have remained broadly the same, his advertising
 strategy has changed dramatically.

<p>Bicycle Space secures customer attachment by organising regular
 group bike rides around the streets of the US capital

<p>"Until about two years ago we put inserts into the Washington
 Post newspaper offering monthly savings by the truck loads.
 But we weren&#039;t sure we were getting good results - so we
 stopped, and now spend the same amount of money on social media,"
 he says.

<p>That enables him to reach customers directly and adapt quickly
 to changing trends. He also invests in sales technology that
 allows him to monitor what customers are buying.

<p>And rather than promote individual products, the company&#039;s
 website takes an elliptical approach, offering information about
 health issues and special diets that link to items available
 in the store.

<p>'Ultimate economy'

<p>By one estimate, 57% of today&#039;s consumers have already made
 up their mind about what they want to buy before entering a
 store or engaging with a sales team. And the way they obtain
 their information has blurred the distinction between marketing
 and advertising.

<p>When Gary Cha started to sell organic produce he had few rivals,
 but that is no longer the case

<p>Marketers say most consumers are more likely to seek out online
 reviews or gather expert advice from independent sources rather
 than listen to a company message. 

<p>As a result, the world&#039;s multinational companies are joining
 small businesses in using insight selling.

<p>And where advertising campaigns used to be a single, high-profile
 event, they now use insight selling to try to establish a continual
 presence in the consumer&#039;s consciousness - which is becoming
 easier thanks to mobile technology. 

<p>In 2010 Volkswagen became the first carmaker to launch a new
 car in the US entirely on a mobile platform. Research revealed
 that the target customers - young men - were also avid iPhone
 users who liked playing games. As a result, Washington-based
 advertising agency AKQA was commissioned to develop an app for
 a game featuring the new Golf GTI.

<p>Within five days Real Racing GTI had been downloaded more than
 800,000 times and became the number one free app on Apple&#039;s
 iTunes App Store in 36 countries. Downloads have since exceeded
 3.7 million.

<p>"It was a minimal investment with a huge impact," says Erik Rogstad,
 managing director of AKQA.

<p>"It&#039;s the ultimate economy - if you have a great viable
 product. If people like it, it will be found and shared and
 talked about and the more people will download it. So there&#039;s
 never been a better time from a digital perspective to get new
 and engaging content out there - especially if you&#039;re a
 small player." 

<p>'Elegantly target' 

<p>Yet other experts sound a note of caution regarding the benefits
 of insight selling via the internet and smartphones, especially
 for small firms.

<p>"Just because it&#039;s digital doesn&#039;t mean it always works,"
 says Russell Glass, chief executive of San Francisco-based marketing
 company Bizo.

<p>Bicycle Space owner Jordan Mittleman uses insight selling to
 compete with online bike sellers

<p>"It&#039;s based on the audience you&#039;re trying to reach
 and the product or service you&#039;re delivering.

<p>"If your audience is not digital, if they&#039;re not consuming
 content online, then no, it&#039;s not important to be digital."

<p>He says many small businesses could do just as well by putting
 up a sign on the High Street.

<p>Mr Glass also thinks it will take another year before businesses
 can take full advantage of the benefits of mobile technology
 because different systems aren&#039;t yet fully compatible.
 

<p>"The opportunity is out there," he says. "But the delivery mechanism
 and the format isn&#039;t - and that&#039;s what needs to shift
 to really make mobile important. For instance viewing a banner
 ad on a mobile device today is really not a very good experience.
 You&#039;re squinting and your fat thumb is clicking on an ad
 by mistake. 

<p>Digital marketing via an extensive and informative website is
 a way for some small retailers to get customers through their
 doors

<p>"But as we start to see more native formats, paid content that
 is within non-paid content, and people start to figure out how
 to more elegantly target adds on mobile devices in a more effective
 way, that is when I think the year of mobile will finally be
 here. That to me is 2014."
