<p>Lois Lerner, the Director of Tax-Exempt Organizations at the
 Internal Revenue Service, has been placed on administrative
 leave. The IRS announced that Ken Corbin will now serve as acting
 director.

<p>The IRS’ new Acting Commissioner Daniel Werfel asked Lerner
 to resign. When she refused, she was then placed on administrative
 leave, according to NBC News.

<p>Lerner was the first agency official to publicly acknowledge
 the current controversy when she responded to a question at
 a conference on May 10. The IRS has been under fire for giving
 special scrutiny to self-identified conservative groups.

<p>Lerner has been under fire since invoking her 5th amendment rights Wednesday
 to avoid answering questions during a House Oversight and Government
 Reform Committee hearing on the matter.

<p>“I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws.
 I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have
 not provided false information to this or any other congressional
 committee,” she said at the hearing. “While I would very
 much like to answer the committee’s questions today, I’ve
 been advised by my counsel to assert my constitutional right
 not to testify or answer questions related to the subject matter
 of this hearing.”

<p>Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, a senior member of the Finance
 Committee with Senate jurisdiction over the IRS, was quick to
 defend Werfel’s request for Lerner’s resignation.

<p>“The IRS owes it to taxpayers to resolve her situation quickly,”
 he said in a statement. “The agency needs to move on to fix
 the conditions that led to the targeting debacle. She shouldn&#8217;t
 be in limbo indefinitely on the taxpayers&#8217; dime.”
