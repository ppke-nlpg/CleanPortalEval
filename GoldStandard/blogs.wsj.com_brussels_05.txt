<h>Bailout Fund Boss Takes Over

<p>Klaus Regling, a former senior official in the European Commission
 and the German finance ministry, has taken over as head of the
 European Financial Stability Fund, the Luxembourg-based special
 purpose vehicle that will issue the bonds that are meant to
 save the euro zone.

<p>This is the press release:

<p>Luxembourg, July 1 2010

<h>European Financial Stability Facility CEO Takes Office

<p>Luxembourg, July 1 2010. Klaus Regling took office on Thursday
 July 1 as Chief Executive Officer of the European Financial
 Stability Facility (EFSF).

<p>The EFSF has been set up by the 16 countries whose currency is
 the euro to provide a funding backstop should a euro area member
 state find itself in financial difficulties.

<p>Commenting on his appointment, Klaus Regling, Chief Executive
 EFSF said:
 “The EFSF is an integral part of the framework
 to safeguard financial stability in Europe. It is important
 that we have the technical and financial capacity to do our
 work if it is needed, and I am putting this in place.”

<h>Notes to Editors:

<p>- EFSF SA is a Luxembourg-registered company owned by euro area
 member states.

<p>- The Board of the EFSF will comprise high level representatives
 of the 16 euro area member states, including Deputy Ministers
 or Secretaries of State or Director Generals of the Treasury.
 The European Commission and the European Central Bank will appoint
 an observer to the EFSF Board.

<p>- It is intended that the EFSF will be a lean organisation. It
 will have a small number of staff and will contract services
 from national and EU institutions, including the European Investment
 Bank. Deutsche Finanzagentur, the German debt management office
 would provide support as the EFSF’s debt issuing agency, if
 required.

<p>- The EFSF will have the capacity to issue bonds guaranteed by
 euro area members for up to €440 billion for on-lending to
 euro area Member States in difficulty, subject to conditions
 to be negotiated with the European Commission in liaison with
 the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund and
 to be approved by the Eurogroup.

<p>- The available amounts under the EFSF will be complemented by
 those of the European Financial Stability Mechanism (€ 60
 billion) and of the IMF.

<p>- The EFSF framework agreement will enter into force once commitments
 have been issued in favour of the EFSF by at least five member
 states representing at least two thirds of the total € 440
 billion guarantee amount. Once such guarantee commitments reach
 90% of the total amount; the EFSF would be authorised to issue
 bonds in the market.
