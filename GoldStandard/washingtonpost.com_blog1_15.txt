<h>Read comments on mobile Web

<p>The Post’s mobile Web site has come a long way since we launched
 last summer. We’ve experimented with storm trackers, election
 maps and Instagram widgets and have worked to keep adding functionality
 as we go.

<p>Our latest release includes one of the features you&#8217;ve been
 asking for: the ability to read comments. These are the exact
 same comments you can see on washingtonpost.com. We will offer
 the ability to write comments via mobile within the next two
 weeks.

<p>As always, please feel free to e-mail mobilewebfeedback@washingtonpost.com
 with your comments and suggestions on the mobile Web.

<p>Thanks for reading!
