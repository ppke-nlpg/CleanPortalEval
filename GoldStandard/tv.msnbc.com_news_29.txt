<h>SEC may require more disclosure from corporations

<p>If there&#039;s one thing we learned from the 2012 election,
 it&#039;s that the already gigantic role that money plays in
 politics is only expanding. Bloomberg View’s Josh Barro, Occupy
 Wall Street activist Alexis Goldstein, Demos’ Liz Kennedy,
 and Jesse Eisinger from ProPublica join Steve Kornacki to talk
 about the campaign finance and forcing public companies to disclose
 political donations.

<p>Nearly a half a million people have signed a petition urging
 the SEC to require greater disclosure from corporations about
 their political donations. On Sunday&#8217;s Up with Steve Kornacki,
 the panel discussed the effect the rule might have, its potential
 benefits and drawbacks, and the broader question of how the
 SEC can (and if it can) regulate money in politics.

<p>As the New York Timesreported on Tuesday, a broad coalition of
 activists, Democratic officials, and other interested parties
 has formed to pressure the Securities and Exchange Commission
 (SEC) to create a new rule that would require publicly traded
 corporations to disclose its political expenditures to its shareholders.
 It is possible to comment directly the SEC and add your opinion
 to the discussion. How does one do it?

<p>If you want to add your voice to the conversation about regulating
 money in politics, corporate speech, and government regulation,

 with the subject: “Comment on File Number 4-637” and add
