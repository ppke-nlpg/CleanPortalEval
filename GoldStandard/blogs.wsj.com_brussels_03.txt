<h>Barroso Backs Ban on Naked CDS

<p>José Manuel Barroso has just said it: The European Commission
 &#8220;will examine closely the relevance of banning purely
 speculative naked sales on credit default swaps of sovereign
 debt.&#8221; That would stop people buying CDS on Greek or Spanish
 debt unless they owned the debt. See previous post for an explanation.

<p>&#8220;It is not justified to buy an insurance&#8230; on a purely
 speculative basis,&#8221; he said.

<p>&#8220;If it is true that the current problems in Greece were not
 caused by speculation on the financial markets, it is also true
 that this speculation was an aggravating factor,&#8221; Mr. Barroso said.

<p>While the mood in Europe seems to be to go ahead anyway, Mr.
 Barroso notes that it would be better if the move was done
 jointly with the U.S. and others through the Group of 20 leading
 economies. &#8220;The Commission will push for international
 coordination. These markets are as mobile as they are opaque. The
 Commission will raise this question with our international partners,
 notably at the level of the G-20.

<p>More cryptically, he raised an approach to financial regulation that
 is being increasingly discussed in the corridors in Brussels: using
 competition policy to deal with the financial markets. That is one
 area of policy that the commission can decide upon itself, without
 reference to politicians or the European Parliament.

<p>On the live issue of a European monetary fund, Mr. Barroso said the
 commission is working on &#8220;a mechanism which Greece could use
 in case of need,&#8221; that would be in conformity with the
 current Lisbon Treaty and with the clause forbidding governments
 from bailing out each other. This would require the support of
 euro area member states.

<p>This suggests, as commission officials hinted yesterday, that he
 thinks a bailout mechanism is possible without opening up any new
 treaty and with the agreement just of the 16 members of the euro
 zone (and possibly a qualified majority) instead of the full EU
 membership of 27.
