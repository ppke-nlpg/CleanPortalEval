<h>The Circuit: Digital activists decry draft of computer bill

<p>Digital activists speak out against draft computer crimes bill:
 Digital activists &mdash; particularly those who called for
 computer crimes reform after the death of activist Aaron Swartz
 &mdash; spoke out against a draft proposal of the Computer Fraud
 and Abuse Act under discussion in the House Judiciary Committee.

<p>Demand Progress, which Swartz helped to found, said that the
 proposal would make the bill more strict and impose stiffer
 penalties on those who break the law. Swartz, who was found
 dead of an apparent suicide in January, had been charged under
 the CFAA for downloading hundreds of articles from an academic
 database.

<p>&ldquo;This is a slap on the face to everybody who&rsquo;s demanded
 reform of our laws and of law enforcement in light of Aaron&rsquo;s
 prosecution and passing,&rdquo; said David Segal, executive
 director of Demand Progress. &ldquo;It's up to all of us to
 make it clear that Department of Justice (DOJ) is overplaying
 its hand and ensure that this proposal is defeated.&rdquo;

<p>Groups weigh in on who should lead FCC: Over 25 organizations
 wrote to Obama on Tuesday, urging him to appoint a strong public
 interest advocate to lead the agency, criticizing Genachowski&rsquo;s
 tenure.

<p>The administration, the groups said, &ldquo;must recognize the
 severe mismanagement and lack of progress that occurred&rdquo;
 under Genachowski&rsquo;s leadership and urged the president
 to consider someone without strong ties to industry lobbying
 groups.

<p>Public interest groups are not the only ones weighing in on who
 should succeed Genachowski.

<p>In a letter dated last week, 37 senators, including Sens. Jay
 Rockefeller (D-W.V.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), wrote to President
 Obama asking him to consider appointing current FCC commissioner
 Jessica Rosenworcel to take Genachowski&rsquo;s place. Rosenworcel
 was confirmed to the commission in May, having served previously
 as legal adviser to former commissioner Michael Copps.

<p>If appointed, Rosenworcel would be the first woman to hold the
 position. The letter points to her expertise and experience
 in the world of telecommunications and media policy and notes
 she had strong bipartisan support during her confirmation hearings.

<p>NYTimes editorial supports online sales tax: In an editorial,
 The New York Times&rsquo;s editorial board supported a bill
 that would allow states to require online retailers to collect
 sales taxes. 

<p>The piece argues that exempting online retailers from collecting
 sales taxes in places where they do not have a physical presence
 give these online retailers an &ldquo;unfair advantage&rdquo;
 over brick-and-mortar stores.

<p>Last week, the Senate voted to approve an amendment that supports
 an Internet sales tax, which indicates strong support for a
 bill that would impose those taxes, the Marketplace Fairness
 Act.

<p>Zuckerberg plans to start political group: Mark Zuckerberg, chief
 executive of Facebook, is reportedly planning to start his own
 political group that would push for legislative reform. According
 to a report from The Wall Street Journal citing &ldquo;people
 familiar with the situation,&rdquo; Zuckerberg is beginning
 to &ldquo;co-organize&rdquo; a group of technology leaders who
 would speak up on a variety of issues such as immigration and
 education.

<p>According to the report, the group does not yet have a name but
 has plans to raise $50 million and register as a nonprofit 501(c)(4)
 social welfare organization.
