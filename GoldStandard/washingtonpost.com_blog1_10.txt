<h>Long Reads: Follow new and classic Washington Post stories

<p>We&#8217;ve partnered with Longreads to bring you some of the
 best of Washington Post journalism. The series will resurface
 long-form articles from our archives. The first installment
 in the series is &#8220;The Spy Who&#8217;s Been Left in the
 Cold,&#8221; a story from the Post&#8217;s Peter Perl, who recently
 announced he&#8217;s retiring after 32 years at the paper.

<p>In 1998, for Washington Post Magazine, Perl profiled Jonathan
 Pollard, the American intelligence analyst who was convicted
 of spying for Israel. In an introduction to Perl&#8217;s article,
 Post reporter Marc Fisher describes the story as one &#8220;of
 deceit and betrayal, but also of devotion and righteousness.&#8221;

<p>Look for more great pieces in the coming weeks on longreads.com.
 And let us know in the comments if you have a favorite Washington
 Post long read.
