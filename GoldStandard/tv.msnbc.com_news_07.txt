<h>The RNC&#8217;s backward-looking tour of nostalgia

<p>Up host Chris Hayes’ Story of the Week is dedicated to the
 GOP’s message on American exceptionalism, and the tale of
 its decline.

<p>This week the Republican party gathered in Tampa to tell a terrible
 and tragic tale of American decline. They couldn&#8217;t quite
 say that, explicitly, of course. This is the party of Reagan
 and sunny optimism, or so they&#8217;d like to present themselves,
 but you couldn&#8217;t help notice that the three days of speeches
 on the convention floor were an orgy of imagined persecution,
 grievance and doleful recollections of halcyon days gone by.

<p>But the packaging for this message was insistent invocation of
 American greatness. As Rachel Maddow&#8217;s team documented
 in a montage for MSNBC&#8217;s convention coverage, almost every
 single speaker told a story of upward mobility, usually taken
 from their own family&#8217;s past: tracing the arc of the American
 dream that had brought them to the podium.

<p>Part of this is just standard political treacle, a way for, say,
 an extremely wealthy prep school graduate like Ann Romney, to
 seem relatable. But the larger reason this was such a dominant
 theme at the RNC is that the Republican Party&#8217;s platform
 and tribal identity are zealously committed to the notion of
 American exceptionalism, and when people talk about American
 exceptionalism, this is usually what they mean.

<p>The notion that America was different and better than other countries, particularly its
 ancestors in Europe, precedes America&#8217;s ascension to the
 role of sole super-power and global hegemon. That America, unblemished
 by the legacy of feudalism, a land without nobles and royalty,
 was a place where each man could rise to any station in life.

<p>Sen. Marco Rubio: &#8220;America was founded on the principle
 that every person has God-given rights&#8230; That power belongs
 to the people. That government exists to protect our rights
 and serve our interests. That no one should be trapped in the
 circumstances of our birth. That we should be free to go as
 far as our talents and work can take us.

<p>Or as Mike Huckabee put it:

<p>&#8220;Our Founding Fathers left taxation and tyranny seeking
 religious liberty and a society of meritocracy rather than aristocracy.&#8221;

<p>We should note that there is something more than a little odd
 about the celebration of American meritocracy at a convention
 convened to nominate a business executive turned governor turned
 presidential candidate who rose from humble origins as the son
 of a business executive turned governor turned presidential
 candidate. A convention that on the same night in which Mike
 Huckabee decried the aristocracy of foreign lands, featured
 Senator Rand Paul, son of congressman Ron Paul, uncorking a
 litany of up by the bootstraps stories shortly before the screening
 of a video that celebrated the last two Republican presidents,
 one the son of the other, who, himself, was the son of a senator.

<p>Somewhat oddly almost every single one of the stories of &#8220;we-built-it,&#8221;
 plucky American success didn&#8217;t revolve around the speakers
 own experience of social mobility but rather that of their hardworking
 relatives and ancestors. It struck me, listening to these invocations
 of the labors of previous generations as a slightly odd note,
 a backward looking tour of nostalgia for an America that we
 are losing. But of course, that&#8217;s precisely the message
 of the Republican party this year and its a potent one because
 it&#8217;s based on a core reality.

<p>The dream of American mobility is slipping away. We all know
 about the extreme and accelerating inequality, but much less
 is made of our stagnating, even declining social mobility. Mobility
 is harder to measure than inequality, but nearly all studies
 show that it has plateaued, or declined for the past several
 decades.

<p>Forty-three percent of those born into the poorest fifth of households
 will stay in the poorest fifth, while only 4% will make it to
 the richest 5th. But 40% of those born into the richest 5th
 of households stay there, and only 8% fall down to the poorest
 fifth. In other words, those born rich stay rich, those born
 poor stay poor, just like those stultifying, bygone aristocracies
 our forefathers fled.

<p>This is the core betrayal at the rumbles beneath the surface
 of our politics, and while the GOP won&#8217;t put it in those
 terms, they understand viscerally the unease and anxiety and
 even desperation it has caused in voters. And they have a story
 to tell about why it happened. It&#8217;s not the excesses of
 global capitalism or american finance or the rigged game of
 rent-seeking, oligopolistic corporate entities who have captured
 Washington, instead it is Barack Obama who, in three quick years,
 single-handedly shifted America away from its meritocratic foundations
 towards an ethos of handouts, welfare and dependence.

<p>That&#8217;s the message. The American dream is dying because
 the first black president is doling out food stamps and welfare
 checks to the lazy and indolent. He&#8217;s seducing Americans
 into dependence, sapping our natural ingenuity, and in the process
 making us, in some deep sense, less America.

<p>It is, of course, ridiculous. First, and most crucially, the
 decline in social mobility is a trend that started well before
 Barack Obama took office. It&#8217;s been part of American capitalism
 for several decades. And the increase of those using the social
 safety net, simply is not Barack Obama&#8217;s doing. It&#8217;s
 the product of the financial crisis and the Great Recession.
 In fact, if anything, our safety net has been remarkably stingy. 
 Despite the fact that 2.6 million more people were living in
 poverty at the end of 2010 than in 2009, only an additional
 7,677 people enrolled in TANF, better known as welfare. And
 aside from one small temporary increase in food stamp eligibility for
 single people without kids during the worst few months of recovery,
 Barack Obama has not expanded food stamp eligibility. In fact,
 the last two expansions of food stamp eligibility came under
 George W. Bush, one of which rightly restored eligibility for
 legal immigrants and earned an &#8220;Ay&#8221; vote from one
 Paul Ryan.

<p>So it&#8217;s not really about the reality of what&#8217;s happened
 to this country in this maddeningly disappointing recovery.
 It&#8217;s about telling voters that the undeserving are making
 out like bandits, while they&#8217;re being robbed of their
 just deserts. For the real subtext of the declaration &#8220;We
 built it&#8221; is, as Clint Eastwood said on the convention&#8217;s
 final night to ear-shattering applause, &#8220;We own this country.&#8221;

<p>And someone else, someone who&#8217;s not us has taken it away,
 &#8220;stolen&#8221; in the phrasing of Reince Preibus talking
 about Medicare, and given it to those other people over there.
 It&#8217;s an ugly message, but in a time of anxiety and diminished
 expectations, not a stupid one.
