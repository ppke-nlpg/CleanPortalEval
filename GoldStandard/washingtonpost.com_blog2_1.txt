<h>Groups offer their two cents on who should be next FCC chair

<p>Groups are rushing to give President Obama their two cents on
 who should be the next chair of the Federal Communications Commission
 following Julius Genachowski&rsquo;s announcement last week
 that he would step down from the post.

<p>Over 25 organizations wrote to Obama on Tuesday, urging him to
 appoint a strong public interest advocate to lead the agency,
 criticizing Genachowski&rsquo;s tenure.

<p>The administration, the groups said, &ldquo;must recognize the
 severe mismanagement and lack of progress that occurred&rdquo;
 under Genachowski&rsquo;s leadership and urged the president
 to consider someone without strong ties to industry lobbying
 groups.

<p>&ldquo;We expect that the administration will put the FCC back
 on course to do its job for this country and choose a nominee
 who will protect the future of communications for all,&rdquo;
 wrote the groups, which include the New America Foundation&rsquo;s
 Open Technology Institute, Fight for the Future, Free Press
 Action Fund and Center for Media Justice.

<p>Public interest groups are not the only ones weighing in on who
 should succeed Genachowski.

<p>In a letter dated last week, 37 senators, including Sens. Jay
 Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) wrote to Obama
 asking him to consider appointing current FCC commissioner Jessica
 Rosenworcel to take Genachowski&rsquo;s place. Rosenworcel was
 confirmed to the commission in May, having previously served
 as legal adviser to former commissioner Michael Copps.

<p>If appointed, Rosenworcel would be the first woman to hold the
 position. The letter points to her expertise and experience
 in the world of telecommunications and media policy, and that
 she had strong bipartisan support during her confirmation hearings.
 The letter also notes that appointing a sitting commissioner
 means Obama can &ldquo;quickly install a proven leader at this
 important agency&rdquo; and avoid delays that outside candidates
 may face.

<p>Top candidates for chairman, The Washington Post reported earlier
 this month, include tech and telecom venture capitalist Tom
 Wheeler, who was a fundraiser for President Obama; Obama&rsquo;s
 ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
 Development Karen Kornbluh; and head of the National Telecommunications
 and Information Administration, the Commerce Department&rsquo;s
 tech and advisory policy arm, Lawrence Strickling.
