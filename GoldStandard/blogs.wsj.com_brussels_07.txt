<h>Crisis in Euro Zone: What Now?

<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy gestures while speaking during
 a final press conference at an EU summit in Brussels on Saturday.

<p>Was Friday the day the governments of the euro zone realized
 the scale of the threat that confronts the common currency?
 If the language used after the summit of euro-zone leaders is
 any guide, the answer is yes. And the extraordinary promise
 to create a mechanism to save the euro zone and impose costs
 on speculators &#8212; details to come after finance ministers
 and others meet on Sunday &#8212; also suggested yes.

<p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, said the euro zone was
 facing the most serious crisis since its creation. &#8220;The
 crisis is systemic; the response must be systemic,&#8221; he
 said.

<p>Months of delays in putting together a Greece bailout package,
 in which the euro zone&#8217;s crisis went from bad to worse,
 were suggesting to many observers, not least in Washington,
 that Europe&#8217;s political leaders had neither the will nor
 the way to stop the crisis in its tracks. In the early hours
 of Saturday morning, the leaders emerged from their meeting
 and said: &#8220;Yes, we can.&#8221; Whether in fact they can
 remains to be seen.

<p>It&#8217;s worth summing up just what was happening in the financial
 markets in past week which has stirred the leaders of Europe.
 Against a backdrop of riots in the streets of Athens, yields
 on the bonds of other euro-zone governments in southern Europe
 climbed alarmingly. Yields on Portuguese two-year bonds rose
 above 8%, on a par with Greek government bond yields just a
 few weeks ago, indicating real default concerns. Stories started
 swirling around that some banks couldn&#8217;t find buyers for
 Italian government bonds. As the euro sank, anxieties grew
 about European banks, many of which are big holders of government
 bonds. It began to look like the second phase of the crisis
 that began with subprime in the U.S.

<p>According to Mr. Sarkozy, a group of leaders arrived early in
 Brussels on Friday to talk about what needed to be done. He,
 Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Angela Merkel of Germany, José
 Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain, José Socrates of Portugal
 met with Herman Van Rompuy, the European Union president, José
 Manuel Barroso, the head of the European Commission, and Jean-Claude
 Trichet, the European Central Bank chief, in caucus before the
 full summit that took place over dinner.

<p>Mr. Sarkozy said the emergency mechanism would be ready by the
 time the markets opened Monday morning and wouldn&#8217;t require
 changes to EU treaties, clearly recognizing that such delays would
 be a signal to resume the assault on the euro-zone&#8217;s
 markets. The ministers&#8217; job Sunday would be to &#8220;finalize
 the technical modalities&#8221; of the package, he said, an
 unfortunate echo of a phrase we often heard earlier in the crisis.

<p>What is contemplated? One possibility is direct borrowing by
 the European Commission, the EU&#8217;s executive arm, which
 would be guaranteed by European nations. A similar structure
 was used in earlier bailouts of non-euro-zone countries such
 as Hungary &#8212; though a different mechanism would have to
 be used to help a euro-zone government. A fund financed in
 this way could, some analysts say, buy government bonds. What
 size would this need to be? The only answer would seem to be:
 Very big.

<p>This raises a lot of questions. According to the summit declaration,
 the meeting Sunday is of the finance ministers of the 27 states
 of the EU &#8212; not just the 16 euro-zone members. Mr. Sarkozy
 spoke of a decision being made, if necessary, using qualified
 majority voting&#8211;suggesting that if any opposition came
 from  governments outside the euro-zone, they might find themselves
 outvoted. It is not clear either whether the non-euro governments
 &#8212; including the current government-in-limbo of the U.K.
 &#8212; would be expected to make a financial contribution.

<p>Moreover, Germany&#8217;s view of all this remains to emerge
 even though Mr. Sarkozy insisted that he and Ms. Merkel were
 at one. As he gave his press conference on a stage bedecked
 by eurozone flags, the German chancellor exited quietly. Perhaps
 more European bailout talk is not what she needs ahead of Sunday&#8217;s
 regional election in North Rhine-Westphalia.

<p>Other elements could also emerge in coming days. To help the
 banks, it is possible that the European Central Bank will announce
 it&#8217;s willing to provide more one-year money to banks,
 replacing a program that rolls off in July. (The prospect of
 the ECB itself buying government bonds may not be efficient
 if the idea is to help ease sovereign debt worries, given the
 central bank appears to be unable to target the markets in which
 it intervenes, as explained here.)

<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve could provide dollars  to Europe at
 some point if it felt that there were shortages. Meanwhile,
 the board of the International Monetary Fund meets Sunday to
 sign off on its contribution to the Greece bailout.

<p>In their story on Washington&#8217;s concerns about events in
 Europe, my colleagues Bob Davis and Jon Hilsenrath say this:

<p>Both Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House economist
 Lawrence Summers like to quote former Mexican President Ernesto
 Zedillo as saying: &#8220;Markets overreact &#8212; and that
 means policy has to overreact.&#8221;

<p>Interesting to hear Mr. Sarkozy echoing that in the early hours
 of Saturday morning. The euro zone is facing “an exceptional
 situation,&#8221; he said, &#8221;to which we have to bring
 an exceptional response.” Quite how exceptional we should
 be able to judge in the next 48 hours.
