<h>Top Gear in Iran: Why do Iranians love Jeremy Clarkson?

<p>It&#039;s the most widely watched factual TV programme in the
 world, according to Guinness World Records - Top Gear is watched
 in 214 territories, and dubbed into eight languages. One of
 the latest countries to succumb to its charms is, unexpectedly,
 Iran.

<p>When Mozaffar Shafeie, an Iranian actor living in London, was
 in Kurdistan a few weeks ago a whisper went round the party
 he was attending.

<p>"Is it him? Is he really the guy that does Top Gear?"

<p>Soon enough a group of Kurdish teenage boys put the question
 directly. Shafeie, who does indeed have a close connection with
 the programme, replied: "Yes, I am Jeremy Clarkson."

<p>They looked sceptical, until he declaimed loudly, "Emshab!" -
 Farsi for "Tonight!", the word with which Clarkson, the show&#039;s
 outspoken and politically incorrect lead presenter, frequently
 opens the programme (usually followed by a long pause).

<p>Shafeie is the voice actor who dubs Jeremy Clarkson into Farsi,
 and this one word sent the boys - and nearby onlookers - into
 a flurry of excited whoops and screams.

<p>"It was like Beatlemania," says Shafeie. "I even signed some
 autographs."

<p>Iranian viewers have been watching the programme on BBC Persian
 TV (PTV) since 2009. 

<p>The BBC cannot operate freely in Iran, so Top Gear&#039;s popularity
 is hard to measure. But last year, when PTV dropped an episode
 to air an exclusive interview with then US Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton, the audience protested bitterly. 

<p>Clarkson himself was aware of the show&#039;s popularity in Iran,
 but still surprised by the outpouring of support.

<p>"Hillary Clinton has got many things to say about Iran," he says.
 

<p>"You&#039;d have thought that the Iranians would have found this
 relatively interesting - more interesting anyway than three
 fat old men falling over. I&#039;m delighted to hear that we&#039;re
 more interesting than Hillary Clinton."

<p>When the Top Gear season ends, PTV replaces it with its sister
 programme Top Gear USA, and this too has prompted complaints,
 one viewer objecting - with Clarkson-like bluntness - that the
 presenters were "not funny".

<p>Shafeie attributes the success of the programme in large part
 to Clarkson&#039;s colourful language and racy anecdotes, which
 he so faithfully dubs into Farsi. Including phrases like "gentlemen&#039;s
 sausage", used to describe a shape he drew on the ground by
 with the tyres of a car, and "Pharaoh&#039;s dried testicles"
 - in reference to some truffles that Jeremy and his fellow presenters
 were tasting.

<h>The Top Gear phenomenon

<l> UK version is watched in 214 territories by 350 million people

<l> Dubbed into eight languages: Farsi, French, Spanish, Italian,
 German, Polish, Hungarian and Russian

<l> The show, first screened in 1977 and relaunched in 2002, has
 stuck to the same theme tune - "Jessica" by The Allman Brothers

<l> Versions (with different presenters) are made in the US, Australia
 and Russia

<p>"I try to get the lip synch precise," he says. "So when you watch
 it, it looks as though Jeremy is speaking Persian."

<p>According to the BBC&#039;s Darius Bazargan, who made a documentary
 in 2008 about motor racing in Tehran, it is Clarkson&#039;s
 irreverence that endears him to Iranian audiences.

<p>"His humour is so inappropriate and not at all what you hear
 on state TV - that must account for some of its appeal," he
 says.

<p>"Jeremy Clarkson is about as opposite to President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad
 as you can get."

<p>But Iranians - who are allowed to buy 60 litres (13 gallons)
 of petrol every month at the subsidised price of 4,000 rials
 (21p or 33 cents) per litre - also love cars.

<p>"There&#039;s always been a car culture in Iran," says Bazargan.
 "It&#039;s a very status driven society, and this predates the
 Islamic Revolution of 1979." 

<p>The Porsche is the ultimate Iranian high-status car, a commonplace
 sight in the affluent neighbourhoods of northern Tehran, though
 the German company stopped selling cars in Iran last year, in
 response to pressure from campaigners against the country&#039;s
 nuclear programme. Maserati and Lamborghini have also recently
 cut all links.

<h>Questions for Clarkson from Iran

<l> Would Jeremy like to come to Iran?

<l> What does Jeremy think of the Paykan?

<l> Did he like the sheep&#039;s head and trotter he ate in the
 Middle East Episode of Top Gear (a popular breakfast dish in
 Iran)

<l> Tell him he can fill up his tank for Â£10 in Iran - does he
 still want to live in UK? 

<p>The former Shah was one Iranian known for his love of classic
 cars, most of which are now housed in the country&#039;s National
 Car Museum.

<p>He was in power when Iran in the late 1960s began manufacturing
 the Paykan, a car modelled on the British Hillman Hunter. This,
 according to Bazargan became feted as "the car of the people"
 - akin to Germany&#039;s Volkswagen. 

<p>Clarkson has described it as "terrible", on the grounds of its
 similarity to the Ford Cortina in which he learned to drive.

<p>"Iranian nukes can&#039;t be very advanced if this is their idea
 of car technology," he once said on air.

<p>But Clarkson says he would welcome the chance to drive one in
 Iran. 

<p>"I&#039;d love to drive through Iran in one of those. It&#039;s
 the sort of thing that Top Gear is all about," he says.

<p>"I&#039;d love to take the show to Iran. We asked, we begged.
 And the (Iranian) ambassador in London was very sympathetic.

<p>"At the time he had a son who was 14 or 15 years old who loved
 Top Gear but there is a rule in place that the BBC isn&#039;t
 allowed to go, so we weren&#039;t allowed go to, which is very
 sad - because we&#039;re not really very political." 

<p>Jeremy Clarkson and Mozaffar Shafeie met one another on The Fifth
 Floor, on the BBC World Service. Listen on iPlayer or download
