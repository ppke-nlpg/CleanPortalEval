<h>Sikh woman&#8217;s graceful response to cyberbully turns would-be
 enemy into ally

<p>Melissa Harris-Perry in her Footnote shares how a Sikh woman
 with facial hair responded to her photo being uploaded onto
 Reddit.com, and how her response was received by the man who
 posted it.

<p>The Internet is a brutal place. Shielded by digital anonymity,
 bullies are emboldened to unleash cruelty that shames, hurts
 and silences their victims. That seemed to be what was happening
 when a young man posted a photo of Ohio State University sophomore
 Balpreet Kaur in the &#8216;funny&#8217; section of social news
 website Reddit.com.

<p>The caption read, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what to conclude
 from this.&#8221; Kaur is a Sikh woman. Her appearance is unusual
 because she has facial hair that she chooses not to remove.
 She did not know this photo was taken. She did not know it was
 posted on the Internet. She did not know that strangers were
 ridiculing her appearance.

<p>When she found out, this was her response:

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a baptized Sikh woman with facial hair. Yes,
 I realize that my gender is often confused and I look different
 than most women. However, baptized Sikhs believe in the sacredness
 of this body&#8230; By transcending societal views of beauty,
 I believe that I can focus more on my actions.&#8221;

<p>No anger. No vitriol. No name calling. With that thoughtful,
 brave, and breathtakingly graceful response, Kaur altered the
 all too familiar storyline of Internet cruelty and personal
 shaming. And she transformed her would-be enemy into her ally.

<p>The young man who posted the photo responded by admitting that
 his original post was &#8220;ignorant.&#8221; He took action
 against that ignorance by reading up on the Sikh faith and reaching
 out to Kaur personally. After reflection he says, &#8220;It
 makes a whole lot of sense to work on having a legacy and not
 worrying about what you look like.&#8221;

<p>This story reminds us of so many things we desperately need to
 remember as we move into the final month of of election season.
 No matter how many times you hear the words battleground state,
 we are not at war with one another. Our neighbors are not our
 enemies. Even when the actions of political candidates communicate
 that it is okay to dehumanize and mock each other. It isn&#8217;t.

<p>Although everybody will be looking to land the best one-liner
 in the debates, what really matters in a democracy is taking
 the time to listen to each other and to learn something.

<p>Thank you Balpreet Kaur for the reminders.
