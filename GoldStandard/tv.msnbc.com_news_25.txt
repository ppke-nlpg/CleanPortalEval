<h>The 3 awesomest things on the Internet #Click3

<p>The New York Times is getting in the haiku business, imaging
 the Keystone XL Pipeline as a bike path, and the Boston police
 department is going undercover online to stop the city’s biggest
 threat: DIY indie-rock shows.

<p>The All In with Chris Hayes team puts out a daily call to the
 Twitter and Facebook communities for the &#8220;awesomest things&#8221;
 they encountered on the Internet.

<p>1.  With the advent of their new on-line project, &#8220;Times
 Haiku,&#8221; The New York Times shows us that reading the
 news can be a doubly enriching experience. Watch Chris as he
 recites his favorites.

<p>2.  Remember the cop who tried to infiltrate Occupy Wall Street
 masquerading as a hipster? Well there&#8217;s a digital incarnation
 of &#8220;Hipster Cop&#8221; trying to gain inside access to
 Boston&#8217;s DIY Indie-Rock scene. Thanks to Twitter fan,
 Shaleen Title, for tipping us off to this droll news item.

<p>@chrislhayes These Boston cops pretending to be &#8220;punks&#8221;
 was funniest thing I&#8217;ve seen in a while slate.com/articles/news_…#click3

<p>3.  Did you know host of All In with Chris Hayes is a big proponent
 of biking? He is. When Twitter fan, Matt Moffat, submitted
 one designer&#8217;s mock-ups of what the Keystone XL Pipeline
 would look like as a transnational bike path, Chris spun a wheelie.

<p>@allinwithchris great show last night. awesome format. looking
 forward to seeing how the show evolves and grows @chrislhayes
