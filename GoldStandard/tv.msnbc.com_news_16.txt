<h>Am I better off now?

<p>So are you better off than you were 4 years ago? Our segment
 producer tries to answer that question. (With the election charging
 towards us, and both candidates on their respective tour routes
 &#8211; there&#8217;s a question we&#8217;re hearing a lot:
 &#8220;Are you better off than you were four years ago?&#8221; Obama
 is going to ask you. Romney is going to ask you. MSNBC is going
 to ask you. FOXNews is going to ask you. It&#8217;s a loaded
 question. You aren&#8217;t supposed to know if they mean financially,
 culturally, spiritually&#8230; It isn&#8217;t specified if gay
 rights, or health care, or the military are supposed to be considered.
 Vagueness by design. But for me, it&#8217;s not really a question
 at all. Four years ago I was giving tours of the 30 Rock studios
 as a Page. I was wearing a peacock tie, and an ill-fitting blue
 blazer with gray slacks. I looked like a sack of potatoes and
 was making $8.50 an hour (after taxes). Don&#8217;t let Kenneth
 fool you, it&#8217;s not all celebrities and shenanigans. It&#8217;s
 four people living in 2-bedroom apartments, stolen meals from
 around the building, and dollar-draft Tuesdays. I had my butt-pinched
 by hyper-aggressive mid-western teenage girls, I got stuck in
 an elevator with 15 panicking Korean tourists, I had a nordic
 youth hockey team get struck with rolling nausea (it&#8217;s
 like rolling blackouts, but it lands on your shoes). I slept
 in the Page Office when I had to be at work at 7:30am on a Sunday.
 I booked an estimated 1 million tickets to &#8220;Late Night&#8221;.
 I slept in Joe Scarborough&#8217;s office a few times when I
 was kinda, sorta homeless for a brief stretch (you didn&#8217;t
 know, but thank you, Joe!). I lived off food the girls in makeup
 (Mary/Tanya/Bilgi/Traci) would bring from their homes and give
 to me in Tupperware. I couldn&#8217;t afford to dry-clean my
 uniform.  My boss hated me and I still don&#8217;t know why.
 I left the knot in my tie for months without untying it.  I
 stood on the floor of Saturday Night Live, and watched the show&#8230;
 live.  I met John McCain, I met Sarah Palin. I met Jay-Z.  I
 worked for a year in NBC&#8217;s famed apprenticeship and didn&#8217;t
 get a single job offer.  I didn&#8217;t have health insurance.
 I didn&#8217;t have a savings account. I could tell you how
 many lights were in the Nightly News studio. I could tell you
 when the SNL studios were built, and why they&#8217;re on spring-loaded
 floors. I could tell you all about Arturo Toscanini. I memorized
 the jokes from Conan&#8217;s warm-up guy. My tours were the
 FULL hour and fifteen minutes. No skimping, you got your money&#8217;s
 worth.  I carried tour-partners that weren&#8217;t funny, or
 weren&#8217;t friendly, or didn&#8217;t know their facts.  They
 carried me when I was Greco-Roman wrestling my beverage choices
 from the night before.  I picked up extra hours when somebody
 needed time off. I made some of my best friends while charging
 down this building&#8217;s famed halls with 30 strangers in
 tow. When I worked at Morning Joe I was there a between 4-5am
 every day.  I moved Joe Scarborough out of his apartment, packed
 the whole place up in less than a day. I worked hard, we all
 did. Pages make a lot of jobs at NBC possible, by helping carry
 the load of time-consuming grunt work. And they do it while
 being made fun of by many of their better-tenured colleagues.
 And you know what? I&#8217;m thankful I had the opportunity.
 Given the choice &#8211; I&#8217;d do it all over again. But
 obviously, I&#8217;m much, much, much better off than I was
 four years ago. Now, I don&#8217;t think I can attribute that
 to the President. He wasn&#8217;t there with me, memorizing
 obscure facts about NBC News anchors, reminding people for the
 48th time that they may not take pictures, or turning away psychos
 that &#8220;just really, really, really need to meet Shia Lebouf.&#8221;
 And thank God, because it would have been much harder to deadpan
 that Jimmy Hoffa was buried under the SNL soundstage with Barry
 staring me down. You know? The point is, the question isn&#8217;t
 fair. It doesn&#8217;t make any sense on an individual basis.
 In the infinite list of variables that got me to where I am
 now (TV producer and blogger-extroadinaire) the President&#8217;s
 impact on me was somewhere between El Nino and the invention
 of the Nike Roche Run. You know what&#8217;s left me worse-off?
 The rise in price of my Metro Card. Sallie Mae hitting me up
 for $120 a month.  My cable bill. The demise of Boston College
 basketball AND football. Who do I vote for to fix those things?
 If there was a Sallie Mae forgiveness/Free HBO &amp; Showtime
 clause in the Ryan Budget I&#8217;d have been in Tampa last
 week with pompoms. I&#8217;d wear elephant underwear and head
 on out to Wolfeboro to help with debate prep. And if I thought
 the President was responsible for the improvement in my living
 (and sleeping) conditions &#8211; I&#8217;d hitch a ride out
 to this week&#8217;s convention and start handing out cookies.
 But I won&#8217;t do either, because the point of &#8220;Are
 you better off than you were four years ago?&#8221; isn&#8217;t
 an answer, it&#8217;s the chatter. And I simply can&#8217;t
 afford to think like that. Literally.  )
