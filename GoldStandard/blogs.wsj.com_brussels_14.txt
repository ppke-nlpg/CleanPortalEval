<h>Russian Riled By Parliament

<p>Members of the European Parliament may struggle sometimes to
 get their voice heard inside the European Union, but they’re
 doing a good job of riling their Russian counterparts.

<p>Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of
 the state Duma, contrasted the “realistic pragmatic approach”
 from the European Commission to the relationship with Russia
 to that it has with “the ideological institutions like the
 European Parliament.”

<p>“There are quite a few people in the European Parliament who
 think the more they take decisions that irritate Russia the
 best it is for Europe. I’m not of this opinion.  There is
 some kind of ideological wave which is unfurling over Europe,
 and it’s a very negative wave,” Mr. Pushkov told a group
 of academics and journalists in Moscow.

<p>On Tuesday, the parliament adopted a recommendation calling on
 EU governments to implement sanctions on a list of officials
 responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky, a subsequent 
 judicial cover-up and for the ongoing harassment of his mother
 and wife. The parliament recommended banning those people from
 entry into the  EU, freezing their assets in the EU, and called
 on Russia to launch an independent investigation into his death.

<p>Mr. Magnitsky, a lawyer who before his 2008 arrest was fighting
 a major corruption case, died in a pretrial detention center
 in 2009 after complaining he wasn&#8217;t receiving necessary
 medical attention. EU nations haven’t acted but the U.S. barred
 entry to a dozen Russian officials connected to the case in
 2011.

<p>This recommendation comes soon after the Pussy Riot punk rock
 band were put on a short list for the annual Sakharov prize
 awarded by the European Parliament for freedom of thought.  The
 winner of the prize, named after the Russian dissident Andrei
 Sakharov, will be announced in December. Two of the three members
 of the group are in jail after staging a protest against Russian
 president Vladimir Putin in a Moscow cathedral.

<p>Awarding the Sakharov Prize to Pussy Riot is “not a great idea,”
 said Mr. Pushkov. “The less they say on these things the best
 it will be,” he said of European parliamentarians. The anti-Russian
 sentiment seemed, he said, to originate in Germany where, on
 a recent visit, he had been told that only people with views
 critical of Russia were allowed to speak on television.
